## Method Assumptions

Table: (\#tab:method-form-ref) Formula for a given method

| Method        | Formula      | Restrictions   |
| ------------- | ------------ | -------------- |
| Least Squares | $y = a + bx$ | No Restriction |
| Chainladder   | $y = bx$     | a = 0          |
| BF            | $y = a + x$  | b = 1          |
| ELR           | $y = a$      | b = 0          |

```{proposition, least-sq, name = "Least Squares Formula"}


$b = \dfrac{\overline{xy} - \bar{x}\bar{y}}{\overline{x^2}-\bar{x}^2} = \dfrac{\mathrm{Cov}(X,Y)}{\mathrm{Var}(X)}$

$a = \bar{y} - b\bar{x}$

Notes:

* In the example here we are looking at the ATA development

* This is effectively a credibility weighting system (giving more or less weight to the observed x as appropriate)

### Caveat with Traditional Method {#Trad-Caveat}

* ***Chainladder***:

    Difficult to select LDF when they vary greatly from year to year

* ***BF***:

    Doesn't work well with negative development
    
* ***ELR***:

    Ignores actual experience
    
* Difficulty with parameter estimation when loss patterns are changing

    * When the **nature of loss experience** is changing the use of unadjusted data can lead to errors

* Variability within a stable book still have sampling error

    $\Rightarrow$ *b* that doesn't reflect the true underlying characteristics

### Least Squares Pros & Cons {#LS-Caveat}

Pros

* Good when dist^n^ is the same across multiple years

* Good when there is little data and fluctuations in the year to year losses

Cons

* Bad when systemic shift year to year e.g. inflation, legal environment (Tort reform)

## Best Estimate based on Bayes (with Theoretical Distribution)

```{proposition, poi-bin, name = "Poisson - Binomial"}
Assume the loss reporting follows a theoretical distribution

* $Y =$ (Ultimate) # of claims incurred each year $\sim Poi(\mu)$

* $X =$ # of claims reported by year end $\sim Bin(y,d)$

    * i.e. each claim have probability $d$ of being reported in the first year

**Ultimate claims** = $Q(x) = x + \mu(1-d)$

**Unreported claims** = $R(x) = \mu(1-d)$

* (Expected # of claims) $\times$ (Expected % Unreported)
    
* Similar to the BF Method

```

```{proof}
$Q(x)$ is the estimator of $Y$. It's the sum of all possible $y$'s $\times$ probability of the result being $y$ given $x$

$\begin{align}
  Q(x) &= \sum \limits_{y = x}^{\infty} y \Pr(Y = y \mid X = x) \\
  Q(x) &= \sum \limits_{y = x}^{\infty} y \dfrac{\Pr(Y = y)\Pr(X = x \mid Y = y)}{\sum_i \Pr(Y = i) \Pr(X = x \mid Y = i)} \\
\end{align}$

And we get Ultimate claims = $Q(x) = x + \mu(1-d)$
```


```{remark}
Simulation of Poi - Bin from paper shows that:

* LDF shows upward bias

* MSE of LDF is higher than MSE of LS
```

```{proposition, nb-bin, name = "Negative Binomial - Binomial"}
Assume the loss reporting follows a theoretical distribution

* $Y =$ (Ultimate) # of claims incurred each year $\sim NB(r, p)$

    * $Y =$ # of failures until $r$ success with success probability = $p$

    * $\mathrm{E[Y]} = \dfrac{r(1-p)}{p}$

* $X =$ # of claims reported by year end $\sim Bin(y,d)$

**Unreported claims** = $R(x) = \dfrac{s}{1-s}(x + r)$ 

* $s = (1-d)(1-p)$
```

## Bayesian Credibility {#bay-cred}

We can't use the Bayes theorem as in the previous section if we don't know the underlying distribution

```{proposition, bayes-ble}
Estimate the ultimate losses using the **best linear estimator** of Y|X, $L(x)$

$L(x) = (x - \mathrm{E[X]})\dfrac{Cov(X,Y)}{Var(X)} + \mathrm{E[Y]}$

* Y = Ultimate Losses; X = Reported Losses

* $L(x)$ = best linear estimator of Y|X = least square estimate

* Use this when we don't know the distribution of the random variable

```

Table: (\#tab:bayes-variance) Formula for a given method

| Scenarios | Implications |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| $x = \mathrm{E[X]}$ | $L(X) = \mathrm{E[Y]}$ |
| $\mathrm{Cov(X,Y)} \ll \mathrm{Var(X)}$ | $L(X) \approx \mathrm{E[Y]}$; Use ELR Method; X, Y don't vary tightly together|
| $\mathrm{Cov(X,Y)} \approx \mathrm{Var(X)}$ | $L(X) \approx x + \mathrm{E[Y - X]}$; Use BF Method |
| $\mathrm{Cov(X,Y)} \gg \mathrm{Var(X)}$ | Y is significantly influenced by X; Use Dev Method|

### Credibility Form of the Dev' Formula {#cred-dev}

```{block2, type='rmdnote'}
Formula is the credibility weighted average of the development and ELR method

$L(x) = Z \underbrace{\dfrac{x}{d}}_{\begin{array}{c} \text{Dev'}\\ \text{Method}\\ \end{array}} + (1-Z)\underbrace{\mathrm{E[Y]}}_{ELR}$

* $L(x) = Q(x)$ when $Q(x)$ is linear
```


```{proposition, cred-dev-m1}
Method 1 for Z

$Z = \dfrac{VHM}{VHM + EVPV} = \dfrac{\mathrm{Var_Y(E[X|Y])}}{\mathrm{Var_Y(E[X|Y])}+\mathrm{E_Y[Var(X|Y)]}}$

* $VHM = d^2 \sigma^2_Y$
    
* $EVPV = \sigma^2_d[\sigma^2_Y + \mathrm{E[Y]}^2]$
    
* Use this when underlying distribution not stable (historical not a good predictor); LS only works when the underlying dist^n^ are stable

* $d =$ % reported

Notes:

* $d \: {\perp\!\!\!\perp} \: X$: reporting speed does not vary with the volume of claims
    
* $D = \dfrac{X}{Y}$
    
Results sensitive to $\mathrm{E[Y]}$ and $\mathrm{E[D]}$ but not the $\sigma$

Based on estimates of VHM and EVPV of the dist^n^ instead
```

```{proposition, cred-dev-m2}
Method 2 for Z

$Z = \dfrac{b}{c}$, where $c$ is the CDF and $b$ is from the LS

* This yield the LS results <span style="color:red">(always?)</span>

* Assume same $d$ for any size of $y$; Not necessarily true for large or small $y$
```

```{proposition, spec-poi-bin, name = "Poisson-Binomial Special Case"}


$L(x) = x + (1-d)\mathrm{E(Y)}$

* $Z = d$

* Same as BF

* **BF is optimal** when claim counts follow Poi - Bin
```

### Caseload Effect {#case-load}

When $D$ and $Y$ not independent still works

* e.g. $d$ larger for small $y$ since small claims are settle faster

* Or the opposite when large $y$ has as larger $d$: For a property book when large weather event happens, report quicker

```{block2, type='rmdnote'}
$L(x) = Z \dfrac{x - x_0}{d} + (1-Z)\mathrm{E[Y]}$

**Assumption**:  
$\mathrm{E[X|Y=y]} = dy + x_0$; $x_0$ is for the fixed salary
```

### Calculation Considerations {#consid}

**Normalize** the losses by dividing with premium since LS assume constant distribution and also ***adjust for inflation***

Calculates ATU, so needs the tail factor first and also start from the oldest period

Recursively go backwards using the previous estimates

$Z = \dfrac{b}{c}$; $c$ is the ATU

Notes:

* $a$ = Projected ultimate if no losses are reported

* AY matures $\Rightarrow a \: \downarrow$; $Z \uparrow$; $c \downarrow$

* If a < 0 $\Rightarrow$ Use Chainladder to make a = 0

* If b < 0 $\Rightarrow$ Use ELR

* If b = 0 $\Rightarrow$ Same as BF

## Conclusions {#conclusions}

LS is the best linear estimate of $Q(x)$, the theoretical best estimate of the ultimate loss

LS produce more reasonable results when year to year fluctuations are severe

LS does not do well when the variations are due to underlying changes in the payment pattern (due to internal or external changes)

* e.g. When there is a systematic shift in the business

Subject to sampling error when estimating parameters similar to other methods
