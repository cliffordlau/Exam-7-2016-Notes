## 7 Problems with Reinsurance Reserving {#prob-of-re}

Problem 1: **Longer claims report lag**

* Claim must be perceived as report-able to the reinsurer by the cedant (e.g. half of the attachment point) and then flow through cedent's system to reinsurer

    * Cedant's reporting system $\Rightarrow$ Cedant's reinsurance accounting $\Rightarrow$ Intermediary (broker) $\Rightarrow$ Reinsurer books the claims $\Rightarrow$ Reinsurer's claim system

* Cedant may undervalue the claim for a long time and thus not reported to the reinsurer

    * See Problem 2 on the cedant reserving to the modal value

* Extreme delays in discovery or reporting for mass tort claims (e.g. asbestos)

Problem 2: **Persistent Upward Development of Most Claim Reserves**

* Economic and social inflation

* Tendency to underestimate LAE

* Tendency of claims to reserve at the modal value

    * Not initially clear which of a group of similar claims will become large so choose the same mostly likely value for all
    
    * Modal value likely under attachment point of treaty so reinsurer does not learn about claim until it is known to be large, which may be several years after reported to primary insurer

Problem 3: **Reporting Pattern Differ Greatly**

* Pattern differs by: LoB, contract type, contract terms, cedant, and intermediary

* Extremely heterogeneous exposures

* Extreme fluctuation in historical loss data due to low frequency and report lags

* Less information on the underlying exposure than primary carrier

Problem 4: **Industry Statistics Not Useful**

* Due to heterogeneity exposures

* Sch P doesn't break down the exposure fine enough and ISO not directly applicable

* Reporting lag grows with attachment point

Problem 5: **Reports Received Lack Important Information**

* Proportional covers require only summary claims info

* Might only have UY or CY info (no AY or PY)

* Limitation of reinsurance premium by primary LoB as an exposure base

    * Reinsurance premium is assigned to line according to a % breakdown estimate made at the beginning of the contract and based upon the distribution of subject premium by line
    
    * To the degree that these % do not accurately reflect the reinsurer's loss exposure by primary line, comparisons of premiums and losses by line maybe be distorted
    
    * Mostly a problem for multi-line proportional treaties
    
* Reporting is typically done with a quarter lag so always missing a quarter of premium

Problem 6: **Data Coding and IT System Problems**

* Again due to the heterogeneity in coverage

* Might have grown in size and complexity faster than data system could handle

Problem 7: **Reserve to Surplus Ratio is Higher for Reinsurer**

* More of a management problem

* Management may underestimate level of reserves need (due to problem 1-6) until claims emerge. Difficulty with actuary convincing management to post the appropriate reserve

***

Standard techniques requires: Homogeneous book, sufficient frequency, and detailed exposure info (Problems 3, 4, 5); Difficult to supplement with industry info

***

Side note on tax impact, reinsurer liabilities are much longer tail than primary and there for the discounted liabilities are smaller and will incur greater income tax

## 6 Components to a Reinsurance Loss Reserve

6 components of a reinsurer's loss reserve

1) **Case reserve** reported by *cedent*

    * Can **individual case reports** (XS contracts) or reported in **bulk** (proportional contracts)
    
2) **Additional Case reserve** from reinsurer (ACR)

    * From reinsurer's claim department's review of individual case reserve reports
    
    * May vary considerably by contract and cedant

3) **IBNER**

4) **Pure IBNR**

5) **Discount** for future investment income

    * For tabular discount as well as for tax purposes
    
    * Tabular discount is on (WC permanent total, auto PIP annuity claims and medical PL)
    
6) **Risk Load**

    * For adverse deviation so uncertain income doesn't flow into profits too quickly
    
    * Can be implicitly built into the reserving assumptions or explicitly
    
## Reinsurance Reserving Procedure

Partition $\Rightarrow$ Development Patterns $\Rightarrow$ Estimate $\Rightarrow$ Monitor and AvE

1. Partition into homogeneous exposure groups that are consistent over time with respect to mix of business

2. Analyze historical development; Ideally, consider case and emergence of IBNR claims separately

3. Estimate future development; Ideally, estimate IBNER and pure IBNR separately

4. Monitor and testing predictions (AvE)

### Step (1): Portfolio Partition

Data needs to be split into reasonably **homogenous** exposure groups that are relatively **consistent over time** with respect to mix of business (exposures)

* Group policies with similar report lags and development profile

Variables to consider when partitioning data in approximately priority order:

* **LoB**  

* **Contract type** (fac, treaty, finite)  

* **Types of Cover** (QS, SS, XS per risk/occ, agg XS, CAT, LPT)   

* **Primary LoB** (for cas)  

* **Attachment Point** (for cas)  

* **Contract terms** (flat-rated, retro rated, sunset clause, LAE share, CM, Occ)  

* **Type of cedant** (Small, large, E&S)  

* **Intermediary** (brokers)

```{r ptf-part, echo = FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.show='hold', fig.cap='Portfolio Partition'}
knitr::include_graphics('figures/FullSizeRender0.jpg')
```

Example:

* Start with the LoB or some other major categories

* Further breakdown into fac or treaty

* All significant XS exposure should be further broken down by type of retention (e.g. per-occ XS vs agg XS)

* Treaty casualty XS should be further broken down by attachment point range and primary LoB (e.g. AL, GL, PL, WC, etc)

* Treaty casualty proportional should be broken down by first dollar primary layers (group-up) vs higher excess layer (excess)

    * Do we also breakdown by primary line?
    
* Facultative casualty: breakdown by automatic primary programs (pro rata share of group-up exposure) vs automatic nonprimary programs (excess)
    
* Certificate exposure should ideally be split by attachment point range

    * Or at least buffer vs umbrella layer and then further by primary line
    
* For property and other exposure: split by pricing categories

Need to **balance** *homogeneity* with *credibility* of data

* Review loss statistics and reporting pattern to see if data is still credible

* Leverage u/w-er, claim handlers and data processors to determine which variables are the most important

### Step (2) & (3): Analyze Distorical Data and Projection

**Backward** looking of historical data (Step 2):  
Analyze the historical development patterns. If possible, consider individual case reserve development and the emergence of IBNR claims separately

* Use long periods where practical and curve fit where practical

**Forward** looking and projection (Step 3):  
Estimate the future development. If possible, estimate the bulk reserve for IBNER and pure IBNR separately

#### Claim Report and Payment Lags

We want to find stable expected development pattern for homogeneous categories

```{definition}
$y = Rlag(t) = p_k$ ($p_k$ is the Clark notation)

Report lag $= \dfrac{1}{ATU \text{at time }t} =$ % Reported to Date
```

```{remark}
Benefits of the above definition:

* We can fit a parametric curve (see Clark) to smooth curves to compute the tail

    e.g. Gamma with $\mu$ = 2.5 years and $\sigma$ = 1.5 years (Figure \@ref(fig:gamma-rpt-lag))

* $Rlag(t)$ can be interpret as probability that any particular claims dollar will be reported to the reinsure by time $t$

* We can compute statistics such as the expected value to compare one claim report pattern with another
```

```{r gamma-rpt-lag, fig.cap = "Claims report lag based on Gamma distribution", echo = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
data_frame(x = seq(0,0.999, 0.001)) %>%
  mutate(y = qgamma(x, shape = 2.5^2 / 1.5, scale = 1.5/2.5)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y,x)) + 
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Claims Report lag",
       subtitle = "Based on gamma with mean = 2.5 and s.d. = 1.5",
       x = "Years",
       y = "% Reported")
```

#### Short Tailed Lines

Loss reporting and settlement is quick

$\therefore$ Use method that provide reasonable accuracy for the least effort and cost

Table: (\#tab:short-tail-lines) Reinsurance categories that are usually short-tailed

| Category I^1^ | Category II | Category III |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| Property | Treaty | Proportional |
| Property | Treaty | Cat |
| Property | Treaty | Excess^2^ |
| Property | Facultative^3^ |  |
| Fidelity |  | Proportional |

1. For property, beware of recent cat events

2. Exclude high layers for XS property

3. Exclude construction
    
* International exposure can have significant reporting delay as well

***Estimation Methods***

* Set IBNR = % of the last 12 months' EP

    * Reasonable for non-major-cat "filtered" claims 
    
    * Claims for major cat may not be fully reported and finalized for years even on proportional covers

* Book LR for new lines

* Allocate claims to AY for reserving (based on historical information)

    * U/w year (or treat year) will have extra lag
    
        Treaty effective 1/1/16 will cover policies inception from 1/1/16 to 12/31/16 and therefore can cover accidents that happens in 12/31/17 $\Rightarrow$ 2 years after the inception of the treaty

#### Medium Tailed Lines

```{definition}
Medium-taild exposure

* Average dollar lag of 1-2 years

* Almost completely settled within 5 years

* Over half the ultimate losses are reported within 2 years
```

Table: (\#tab:medium-tail-lines) Reinsurance categories that are usually medium-tailed

| Category I | Category II | Category III | Category IV |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| Property | Treaty | Excess | High layers^1^ |
| Construction^2^ | | | |
| Surety | | | |
| Fidelity | | Excess | |
| Ocean Marine | | | |
| Inland Marine | | | |
| Property | | | International |
| Non-casualty | | Excess | Aggregate^3^ |

1. Ideally separate from working layers

    * Ultimate value may not be known immediately and will take longer to penetrate higher per-risk XS attachment point

2. Ideally separate from other property exposures

    * Discovery period can extend years beyond the contract period

3. Lags are longer then the underlying exposure

* For surety should estimate gross and recovery separately as the recovery has a longer tail

    * Consider the ratio of salvage to gross loss for mature years

***Estimation Methods***

* Chainladder works fine for paid and incurred with or without ACR

#### Long Tailed Lines

```{definition}
Long-taild exposure

* Exposures which the average aggregate claims dollar report lag is over 2 years

* Claims are not settled for many years
```

Table: (\#tab:medium-tail-lines) Reinsurance categories that are usually long-tailed

| Category I | Category II | Category III | Category IV |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |------------ |
| Casualty | Treaty | Excess^1^ | |
| Casualty | Treaty | Proportional^2^ | |
| Casualty | Facultative | | |
| Casualty | | Excess | Aggregate^3^ |
| APH^4^ | | | |

1. Longest lags except for APH

2. Some of this exposure maybe medium-tailed

3. Lag are longer than for the underlying exposure

4. Asbestos, pollution, and other health hazard and mass tort claims

    * Longest of the long tail
    
    * Should be remove from data and analyzed separately
    
    * Use methods specifically for APH
    
    * Exclude claims from commuted contracts as they distort development patterns
    
* Need to separate the above into finer, more homogeneous categories (e.g. separate claims-made and occurrence coverage)

***Estimation Methods***

* **Chainladder** (*BF*):

    Don't use, too much leverage

* **Bornhuetter-Ferguson** (*CL*):

    Better than *CL*, correlate future development with an exposure measure (reinsurance premium): Premium $\times$ ELR

    * Caveat 1): Very dependent on selected LR
    
        LR for a given AY is strongly correlated with the underwriting cycle as well as the reported loss to date
        
        $\therefore$ need to consider the u/w cycle in ELR pick
        May use LR from pricing work
        
    * Caveat 2): Estimate for each AY does not reflect the reported to date (unless the selected LR is chosen with that in mind)

* **Stanard Buhlmann** (*SB* or Cape Cod in Europe):

    $ELR = \dfrac{\sum C_k}{\sum E_k p_k}$

    * $C_k$: reported to date; $E_k$: Adj Prem; $p_k$: expected % reported to date; $k$ is the exposure year
    
    * Must on-level the historical premium and adjust to be pure premium ($E_k$)

        * Remove commissions and brokerage and internal expenses (but might not worth the effort)

        * Remove any suspected rate level differences (so each year have the same ELR)
        
    * *SB* IBNR $= E_k(1-p_k) \times ELR$
    
    * Remark:
    
        This estimate of the ELR use actual incurred loss

        Method is sensitive to the accurary of the on-level EP
    
* **Credibility IBNR Estimates**:

    Weight the *CL* method with *SB* or *BF*
    
    Reserve for year $k$: $\hat{R}_k = Z_k \times R^{CL}_k + (1-Z_k)\times R^{SB}_k$

    * $Z_k = p_k \times CF$; Credibility Factor $CF \in [0,1]$

        $CF = 0$ $\Rightarrow$ *BF*
    
        $CF = 1$ $\Rightarrow$ Benktander (*GB*)
        
    * Can also weight together the IBNR estimate from paid loss method
    
        Case reserve are based on judgement of many people and can vary over time (lack consistency) $\Rightarrow$ Given long enough paid history, paid estimate might be more stable and credible
        
    * Or weight with *BF* based on different a-priori (e.g. based on pricing ELR)

* **Alternative Methods**:

    * Fit losses reported to date to a curve (Clark)
    
        Practical problem: negative incrementals (get around by grouping over different periods)

    * Model claim counts and use stochastic model (Bootstrap) for the whole claims development process
    
        Caveat: difficult to explain to management
        
        Advantage: Can contemplate intuitively satisfying models for various lag distributions
        
        * Time from loss to first report and lag from report to settlement
        
        * Connect the lags with appropriate models for the dollar reserving and payments on individual claims up through settlement

### Step (4): Monitoring and Testing Predictions

Compare AvE over quarters and do this for several quarters to see if any trends become apparent

* Forecast IBNR runoff over the quarters

* Provides early warning if claims are emerging higher than expected

```{definition}
Expected reported claims

$\dfrac{\text{Expected % Reported in Period}}{\text{Expected % Unreported}} \times IBNR$
```

Caveat:

* Can be difficult to tell if the AvE difference is large or small

    $\therefore$ Look for deviations over time and look for trends

* Deviation could be IBNR is too small, claims are paying faster than expected, or just random fluctuation
