Experience rating of a single car for 1 year has significant and measurable credibility for experience rating\n    * Credibility for the 1 year range between [0.038, 0.071] $\\Rightarrow$ Imply some credibility is warranted for the experience of a single car for a single year of claims-free experience\n\n2. Individual risk experience is more credible when there is more variance in loss experience within a risk class (less refined risk classification system)\n    * Class 2-5 are more narrowly defined than class 1, so less credible in classes 2-5\n\n3. Credibility for varying years of experience should increase in proportion to the # of years of experience (This test the point above)\n    \n    * Stability across time\n    * Only for low credibility\n\n4. The closer the credibility for 2 and 3 years of experience are to 2 and 3 times the 1 year credibility $\\Rightarrow$\n    \n    * Less variation in the insured's $\\mathrm{Pr(Accident)}$;\n    * Less risk entering/ exiting the portfolio; \n    * Risk characteristics not changing much over time\n    * Only for low credibility values\n    * Opposite when the ratios are less than the multiples\n\n## Bühlmaan Credibility  \n<a name=\"buhlmaan\"></a>\n\n$Z = \\dfrac{n}{n + k}$\n\n* n = # of claims in sample\n\n$k = \\dfrac{\\mathrm{E[Var(X|\\Theta))]}}{\\mathrm{Var(E[X|\\Theta])}} = \\dfrac{\\text{Expected Process Variance}}{\\text{Variance of Hypothetical Mean}}$\n\nIf $X \\sim Poi(\\lambda), \\space \\lambda \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2) \\Rightarrow k = \\dfrac{\\mu}{\\sigma^2}$\n\n$k$ is constant for different sample of $n$ sizes taken from the $X$ variable\n\nPaper backs into $k$ by assuming $n=100$ $\\Rightarrow$ $Z=0.046$ then recalc $Z$ for other values of $n$",
