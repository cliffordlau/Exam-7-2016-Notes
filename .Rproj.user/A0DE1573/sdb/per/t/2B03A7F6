If % not correctly reflect loss exposure, premium by line may be distorted\n    \n* Reporting is typically done with a quarter lag so always missing a quarter of premium\n\nProblem 6: **Data Coding and IT System Problems**\n\n* Due to the heterogeneity in coverage\n\n* Might have grown in size and complexity faster than data system could handle\n\nProblem 7: **Reserve to Surplus Ratio is Higher for Reinsurer**\n\n* Management problem\n\n* Management may underestimate level of reserves need until claims emerge and difficulty with actuary convincing management to post the appropriate reserve\n\n***\n\nStandard techniques requires: Homogeneous book, sufficient frequency, and detailed exposure info (Problems 3, 4, 5); Difficult to supplement with industry info\n\n## 6 Components to a Reinsurance Loss Reserve\n\n1) **Case reserve** reported by *cedent*\n\n    * Summary reporting for proportional contracts\n    \n    * Individual case reports for XS contracts\n    \n2) **Additional Case reserve** from reinsurer\n\n3) **IBNER**\n\n4) **Pure IBNR**\n\n5) **Discount** for future investment income\n\n    * For tabular discount as well as for tax purposes\n    \n6) **Risk Load**\n\n    * For adverse deviation so uncertain income doesn't flow into profits too quickly\n    \n## General Reinsurance Reserving Procedure\n\nPartition $\\Rightarrow$ Development Patterns $\\Rightarrow$ Estimate $\\Rightarrow$ Monitor and AvE\n\n### Portfolio Partition\n\nData needs to be split into reasonably **homogenous** exposure groups that are relatively consistent **over time** with respect to mix of business (exposures)\n\nVariables to consider when partitioning data in approximately priority order:\n\n**LoB** $\\Rightarrow$ **Contract type** (fac, treaty, finite) $\\Rightarrow$ **Types of Cover** (QS, SS, XS per risk/occ, agg XS, CAT, LPT) $\\Rightarrow$ **Primary LoB** (for cas) $\\Rightarrow$ **Att Pt** (for cas) $\\Rightarrow$ **Contract terms** (flat-rates, retro rated, sunset clause, LAE share, CM, Occ) $\\Rightarrow$ **Type of cedant** (Small, large, E&S) $\\Rightarrow$ **Intermediary** (brokers)\n\n![alt text](figures/FullSizeRender.jpg)\n\nNeed to balance homogeneity with credibility of data\n\nReview loss statistics and reporting pattern to see if data is still credible\n\n### Analyze Distorical Data and Projection\n\nBackwards looking (Step 2): Analyze the historical development patterns. If possible, consider individual case reserve development and the emergence of IBNR claims separately\n\n* Use long periods where practical and curve fit where practical\n\nForward looking projection (Step 3): Estimate the future development. If possible, estimate the bulk reserve for IBNER and pure IBNR separately\n\n**Short Tailed Lines**\n\nSettlement is quick, basic methods work fine\n\nFor property, beware of recent CATs\n\nExclude the high layers for XS property\n\nExclude construction for Fac Prop\n\nFidelity proportional is short tail as well\n\nBook LR for new lines and maybe allocate claims to AY for reserving\n\n**Medium Tailed Lines**\n\nAverage dollar lag of 1-2 years and nearly complete within 5 years\n\nXS Property (separate from working layers), Construction (separate from other), Surety, XS Fidelity, Marine, Agg XS (non-casualty)\n\nSurety should estimate gross and recovery separately as the recovery has a longer tail\n\nChainladder works fine for paid and incurred with or without ACR\n\n**Long Tailed Lines**\n\nAny time of casualty reinsurance, XS Cas is the longest before APH\n\nAPH should be analyzed separately:\n\n* Use different methods specifically for APH\n\n* Separate commuted contracts\n\n***Chainladder***:\n\n* Don't' use, too much leverage\n\n***BF***:\n\n* Better than CL\n\n* Dependent on selected LR\n\n    * Consider u/w cycle in selecting LR since AY LR is strongly correlated to the place in the reinsurance profitability cycle\n\n    * May use LR from pricing work\n    \n***Stanard Buhlmann***:\n\n* Must on-level the historical premium and adjust to be pure premium\n\n    * Remove commissions and brokerage and internal expenses (but might not worth the effort)\n\n    * Remove any suspected rate level differences\n\n* $ELR = \\dfrac{\\sum C_k}{\\sum E_k p_k}$\n\n    * $C_k$: reported to date; $E_k$: Adj Prem; $p_k$: expected % reported to date\n    \n***Credibility IBNR Estimates***:\n\nWeight the CL method with SB or BF\n\n* $R_k = Z \\cdot R_{CL} + (1-Z) \\cdot R_{SB}$\n\n* $Z_k = p_k \\cdot CF$, $CF \\in [0,1]$\n\n* $CF$ is the credibility factor, Benktander = 1, BF = 0\\\n\n***Alt Methods***:\n\nFit losses reported to date to a curve\n\nModel claim counts or use stochastic model (Bootstrap). Caveat being that it might be difficult to explain to management\n\n## Monitoring and Testing Predictions\n\nCompare AvE over quarters and do this for several quarters to see if any trends become apparent\n\nExpected = $\\dfrac{\\text{Expected % Reported in Period}}{\\text{Expected % Unreported}} \\times IBNR$\n\nSometime difficult to tell if the difference is large or small\n\nLook for deviations over time and look for trends\n\nIt could be IBNR is too small, claims are paying faster than expected, or just random fluctuation",
