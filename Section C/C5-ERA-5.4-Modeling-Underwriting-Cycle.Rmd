## Introduction

Important to consider how the firm interacts with a competitive environment in an ERM framework

Price competition is inevitable due to: Low barriers of entry; lack of patent or copyright product

Price is difficult to define since it depends on premium charged as well as limits, deductible, terms and conditions

U/w cycle:

* Recurring increase and decrease of prices and profits

* Result of a dynamical system with both feedback and external shocks and slow adjustment

* Each LoB has it's own cycle

* Capital plays an important role $\Rightarrow$ multiline insurers creates dependencies between LoBs' cycle

### 4 Stages Insurance Business {.tabset}

Steward describes the evolution of insurance business, sometimes takes decades to play out

#### 1. Emergence
    
Classic u/w-ing cycle here at this stage

* New LoB, thin data, inaccurate pricing
* $\hookrightarrow$ $\uparrow$ demand with erratic pricing $\Rightarrow$ Price wars
* $\hookrightarrow$ solvency crisis $\Rightarrow$ force out weak competitors $\Rightarrow$ price correction
* $\hookrightarrow$ $\uparrow$ profitability $\Rightarrow$ new entrants and repeat
    
#### 2. Control

Stop the cycle with help from rating bureau or insurance department
    
#### 3. Breakdown

Control regime breaks down due to new technology or social changes

New type of competitors take business away
    
#### 4. Reorganization

Return to stage 1, new configuration of the market phase emerges
    
## Theories of the Cycle

Different researches findings are contradictory

**Institutional Factors**

Lags in data

Reporting and regulatory delays leads to 2^nd^ order autoregression

**Competition**

Low prices by one competitor can push prices down

Companies strategy is either aggressive growth or price maintenance

4 phases of cycle: cheating, pain, fear, restoration

**Capital Constraints**

Capital determines the available supply of insurance

Capital is not replaced quickly once reduced

* Best clients may leave first when capital $\downarrow$ $\Rightarrow$ anti-selection

**Economic Linkages**

Profitability of firm links to investment income, cost of capital

Expected losses may depend on interest rates, inflation

Price of risk set by the market is generally ignored by insurers

**All of the Above**

No single theory can explain the u/w cycle completely

## Approaches to Modeling the Cycle

First we define what it is we want to know and look for leading indicators that foretell the turn in the cycle

**Criterion Variable**

The concern is price, but impossible to define in insurance

Use loss ratio or combined ratio etc as a proxy

* Can include investment income

**Predictor Variable**

To calculate the current period criterion and also forecast the forward period criterion

* Historical criterion variable: loss, expense
* Internal financial variables: reserve, capital, capital flow, reinsurance cessions
* Regulatory rating variables: rating changes
* Reinsurance sector financials: capital held
* Econometric variable: inflation, unemployment, GDP
* Financial market variables: interest rates, stock market returns

**Competitor Intelligence**

Gather information on customers at renewal time and competitors

* Trade publications and rate filings
* Need to beware of antitrust and legal issues

### Styles of Modeling {.tabset}

#### Soft Approach

Focuses on gathering expert opinion

* Data quality, variety, complexity, and human factors

Human approach, focused on three methods:

1) Scenarios

    * Detailed written statement describing a possible future state of the world
    
2) Delphi Method

    * Gather expert opinion without biasing the group to the opinion of the most senior persons
    
    * Multiple rounds of providing information and questions
    
3) Formal Competitor Analysis

    * For at financials, news item, behavioral metrics
    
    * Look for unusual profitable or distressed financial conditions across a large number of firms
    
#### Technical Approach

Focuses on statistical modeling, mathematical formalism and rigor

**Autoregressive Model**

Research shown cycle can be modeled with $AR(2)$ or $AR(3)$ model

For $AR(2)$: $X_t = b_o + b_1 X_{t_1} + b_2 X_{t-2} + \sigma \epsilon_t$

Use autoregressive model to model P&C industry combined ratios

Results showed weak mean regression with lag 1 but strong mean regression at lag 2

Model can be used to forecast a few periods into the future and estimate the distribution for those forecasts

***

**VARMAX**

Generalized multivariate time series that can utilize external variables

***

**General Factor Model**

* Looks like $AR(1)$ but with non-normal mean and a moving temporary mean

* $X_t = c + d(Z_{t-1} - X_{t-1}) + \tau \delta_t$

    * $Z_t = a + b \cdot Z_{t-1} + \sigma \epsilon_t$
    
    * $Z_t$ maybe an unknown or unobservable variable
    
Complicated to fit this model

#### Behavioral Modeling

Econometric Modeling

* Sit between soft and technical model's concern for structural insight (soft) and statistical validity (technical)

Can be done at an industry level or company level

* Industry level can be more detailed

* Company level requires maintaining many individual models and their interactions

    * May reveal emergent properties (See ERA 4.2)
    
## Supply and Demand

Plotting the supply and demand curve on quantity vs price

![alt text](figures/Exam 7 Notes - 6.png)

**Supply**

New competition or technology increases the quantity available at a given price $\Rightarrow$ Shifting curve $\searrow$

Higher capital requirement $\Rightarrow$ Shifting curve $\uparrow$

**Demand**

Excess capital makes insurance more valuable $\Rightarrow$ Shifting curve $\nearrow$

Shock to capital $\Rightarrow$ Shifting curve $\swarrow$

Company demand curve will be flatter since customers can go to another company for small changes in price

***

More intuitive to think of quantity as a function of price

Market price is where supply meets demand

Difficult to empirically estimate the curves because only the equilibrium is observable

***

**Gron Supply Curve**

The first flat section:

* There is a minimum price = expected losses + marginal expenses
* Supply is perfectly elastic for a certain quantity, where the supply 
will increase without an increasing price

The curved section:

* At certain point firm will require additional capital to support the business, and the price must increase
* Once price hits a a certain level, profits are enough to cover the additional capital and the supply curve approaches a price asymptotically

Shock scenario:

* Curve would simply shift $\leftarrow$
* Expected loss + marginal expense is still the same, while the amount of capital the company have before it needs to seek additional capital has changed

## Capital Flows

![alt text](figures/Exam 7 Notes - 7.png)

* Capital $\uparrow$ in a firm from retained earnings and capital infusions

* Capital $\downarrow$ from operating losses and capital withdrawal

* Capital is attracted when profit expectations are high

* Capital exits either voluntarily or under financial distress

## Assembling the Components

![alt text](figures/Exam 7 Notes - 8.png)

* Economic factors and capital both affect the supply and demand curves

* Level of price and losses affect the supply curve

* Capital is impacted directly by premium and losses and specifically profitability

Output of this model is an equilibrium price

The behavioral model can be used to simulate a dist^n^ of this price

## Conclusion

U/w cycle is the behavior of a complex dynamic system

Output of the modeled u/w cycle should feed into the firm's demand and retention models

* They help to forecast how clients will react to the difference between the firm's pricing and that of other prices available in the market
