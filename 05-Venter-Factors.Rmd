## Definitions and Assumptions

Table: (\#tab:venter-mack-def) Tables of Definitions

| Venter Notations | Definitions | Mack Notations (\@ref(def:mack-1994-def)) | 
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------|----------- |
| $w$       | AYs | $i$ |
| $d$       | Dev period; $d=0$ is age @ end of year 1 | $k$ |
| $c(w,d)$  | Cumulative losses for AY $w$ age $d$ | $c_{i,k}$ |
| $c(w,\infty)$  | Ultimate losses for AY $w$| $c_{i,I}$ |
| $q(w, d+1)$ | **Incremental** losses for AY $w$ age $d$ to $d+1$ | |
| $f(d)$    | Col parameters; **(LDF - 1)**; applies to whole col | $f_k - 1$ |
| $F(d)$    | LDF to ultimate that applies to $c(w,d)$ | |
| $h(w)$    | Row parameters; applies to whole row | |

### Mack's Chainladder Assumptions

Same assumptions as the [Mack 1994](#cl-ass) but stated in Venter's terminology

```{proposition, mack-ass-1, name = "Mack Assumption 1"}
$$\mathrm{E}[q(w,d+1) \mid \text{Data to } w+d] = f(d) \times c(w,d)$$
```

```{remark}


* Here $f(d)$ is LDF - 1

* Expected incremental development is $\propto$ reported losses

* See also (Prop \@ref(prp:cl-ass-1)) from Mack (1994)
```

```{proposition, mack-ass-2, name = "Mack Assumption 2"}
$$c(w,d) \perp\!\!\!\!\perp c(v,g) \:\:\:\: \forall \: d,g,v,w \:\:\:\: : \:\:\:\: v \neq w$$
```

```{remark}


* Losses not in the same row are independent of each other

* See also (Prop \@ref(prp:cl-ass-2)) from Mack (1994)
```

```{proposition, mack-ass-3, name = "Mack Assumption 3"}
$$\mathrm{Var}[q(w,d) \mid \text{Data to } w+d] = a_{fun}\big(d,c(w,d)\big)$$
```
    
```{remark}


* Variance of incremental losses depends only on:

    1. Cumulative losses reported to date $c(w,d)$
    
    2. Age of the AY $d$ (Does not vary by AY down the column)

* Different $a_{fun}(\cdots)$ leads to different $\hat{f}(d)$ estimate

* See also (Prop \@ref(prp:cl-ass-3)) from Mack (1994)
```

### Variance Assumptions (for Chainladder)

Same as shown in Mack 1994 Table \@ref(tab:CL-var-weight)

Table: (\#tab:venter-var-weight) Relationships between weight, variance and residual (Venter)

| Weight | Description | Variance $a_{fun}\big(d,c(w,d)\big)$ | LDF - 1 $f(d)$ |
| --------------- | ------------------------ | ------------ | --------------- |
| 1                | Simple Average | $k(d)c(w,d)^2$ | $\dfrac{\sum_w 1 \frac{q(w,d+1)}{c(w,d)}}{\sum_w 1}$ |
| $c(w,d)$        | Weighted Average | $k(d)c(w,d)$ | $\dfrac{\sum_w c(w,d) \frac{q(w,d+1)}{c(w,d)}}{\sum_w c(w,d)}$ |
| $c(w,d)^2$      | Least Square | $k(d)$ | $\dfrac{\sum_w c(w,d)^2 \frac{q(w,d+1)}{c(w,d)}}{\sum_w c(w,d)^2}$ |

* $c(w,\infty) = F(d)c(w,d)$

    $F(d) = \prod_{s \geq d} (1 + f(s))$
    
* Recall $\dfrac{q(w,d+1)}{c(w,d)}$ are the empirical LDF - 1

$\mathrm{E}[q(w,d+1)] = f(d)c(w,d)$

* $n = \sum \limits_{i=1}^{m-1} i = \dfrac{m(m-1)}{2}$ = predicted data point?

* $p=m-1$ since we dont' predict the first column

* $m =$ dimension

### Goodness of Fit Measurement

Compare different fit of the models based on adjusted $SSE$ (actual vs projected **excluding** 1st column)

Adjusted *SSE*

\begin{equation}
  \dfrac{SSE}{(n-p^2)}
  (\#eq:adj-sse-venter)
\end{equation}

Akaike Information Criterion

\begin{equation}
  AIC \approx SSE \times e^{2p/n}
  (\#eq:aic-venter)
\end{equation}

Bayesian Information Criterion

\begin{equation}
  BIC \approx SSE \times n^{p/n}
  (\#eq:bic-venter)
\end{equation}

```{remark}


* $n =$ # of predicted data points **EXCLUDING 1st column**

    * Exclude because when we do reserving we don't predict anything from the first column
    
    * Usually the triangle excluding the first column

* $p =$ # of parameters

* $SSE = \sum (A - E)^2$

    * Here you exclude the first column when calculating the difference
    
* Venter use the adjusted SSE as the AIC can be too permissive of over parameterization for large data sets
```

### Implication 1: Significance of Factors {#venter-imp-1}

Check if the parameter coefficient is $> 2 \sigma$ for 95% sure that the parameters are $\neq 0$

* Can do $1.65 \sigma$ for 90% confidence

* Remember $f(d)$ is LDF - 1

* LDFs tend to fail towards the tail

### Implication 2: Superiority of Alternative Emergence Patterns {#venter-imp-2}

If an alternative emergence pattern provides a better explanation of the triangle, maybe it should be used

Table: (\#tab:venter-alt-pattern) Alternative emergerence pattern on a $m \times m$ triangle

| Emergence Patterns | # of Parameters | Comments |
| ------------------------------ | ---------- | ------------------------ |
| $\mathrm{E}[q(w,d+1) \mid \text{Data to }w+d] = f(d) c(w,d)$ | $m - 1$ | e.g. Chainladder |
| $\mathrm{E}[q(w,d+1) \mid \text{Data to }w+d] = f(d) c(w,d) + g(d)$ | $2m - 2$ | e.g. Least Squares |
| $\mathrm{E}[q(w,d) \mid \text{Data to }w+d] = f(d)h(w)$ | $2m-2$ | e.g. BF |
| $\mathrm{E}[q(w,d) \mid \text{Data to }w+d] = f(d)h$ | $m-1$ | e.g. Cape Cod |

```{remark}
$f(d) c(w,d) + g(d)$

* Often significant in forecasting age 1
```

```{remark}
$f(d)h(w)$

* Here $f(d)$ is related to the % of losses emerged in period $d$

    Not LDF -1
    
* $h(w)$ can be think of as an estimate of ultimate losses for AY $w$

    Like an a-priori
    
* The -2 for the BF is due to $f(0)$ and constant

* If BF is better $\Rightarrow$ Loss emergence is more accurately represented as fluctuating around a proportion of expected ultimate losses (rather than proportion of reported losses)

* Cape Cod works when the loss ratio is stable (stable book of business)

    * Use $h(w) = h \times Premium(w)$, so we only need stable ELR

* Can further reduce parameters by combining some row and column parameters
```

#### Variance Assumptions: Alternative Emergence Pattern

Minimize sum of squared error for the optimal parameters:

* e.g. error term for BF: $\varepsilon(w,d) = q(w,d) - f(d)h(w)$

Different variance assumption for $\varepsilon$ $\Rightarrow$ different parameters

$\mathrm{Var}(\varepsilon) = f^p h^q$

* $p$ & $q$ typically in (0,1,2)

* Weights will be $\dfrac{1}{f^p h^q}$ (inversely proportional to variance)

* $f(d)$ = weighted average of $\frac{q}{h}$

* $h(w)$ = weighted average of $\frac{q}{f}$

Table: (\#tab:venter-var-weight-BF) Variance and parameters for various form of $\mathrm{E}[q(w,d) \mid \text{Data to }w+d] = f(d)h(w)$

| Method | $\mathbf{\mathrm{Var}(q)}$ | $\mathbf{f(d)}$: Col Parameters | $\mathbf{h(w)}$: Row Parameters |
| ------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| BF (Constant Var, Least Square) | $a(d); p=q=0$ | $f(d) = \dfrac{\sum_w h^2 \frac{q}{h}}{\sum_w h^2}$ | $h(w) = \dfrac{\sum_d f^2 \frac{q}{f}}{\sum_d f^2}$ |
| Cape Cod | $a(d); p=q=0$ | $f(d) = \dfrac{\sum_w h^2 \frac{q}{h}}{\sum_w h^2}$ | $h = \dfrac{\sum_\Delta f^2 \frac{q}{f}}{\sum_\Delta f^2}$ |
| BF (Var $\propto$ $fh$)| $a(d) \cdot f \cdot h; p=q=1$ | $f^2(d) = \dfrac{\sum_w h (\frac{q}{h})^2}{\sum_w h}$ | $h^2(w) = \dfrac{\sum_d f (\frac{q}{f})^2}{\sum_d f}$ |

* $f(d)$ is % losses paid @ $d$

    * Estimate by $\frac{q}{h}$

* $h(w)$ is estimate of ultimate losses

    * Estimate by $\frac{q}{f}$

* $f(d)$ $\sum \downarrow$; $h(w)$ $\sum \rightarrow$ (for the constant var BF)

* Need to seed one of them and iterate until convergence

* Use the above to estimate the parameters and then calculate the unpaid

* When combining parameters, don't count the $f(0)$ and always subtract 1
    
### Implication 3: Linearity {#venter-imp-3}

The forecast incremental losses doesn't have to be linear

Test for linearity to make sure the residuals are not a sequence of positive then negative and vice versa

### Implication 4: Stability {#venter-imp-4}

Look at empirical LDFs $f(d)$ down a column

* Use the entire history if factors are stable

* Take more recent average if unstable or follow a trend

### Implication 5: No Correlation on Columns {#venter-imp-5}

Calculate Pearson correlation for every pair of columns with at least 3 LDFs

* This is a test on the LDFs

* Test with only 2 LDFs will either be 1 or -1

Correlation $r = \dfrac{\sum \tilde{x} \tilde{y}}{\sqrt{\sum \tilde{x}^2\sum \tilde{y}^2}}$

* $\tilde{x} = x - \bar{x}$

* $\tilde{y} = y - \bar{y}$

Test statistics: $T = r \sqrt{ \dfrac{n-2}{1-r^2} }$

* $T \sim t_{n-2}$

* Look up the t-value from table for 90%

* If the absolute value of $T <$ table value $\Rightarrow$ Not correlated

Perform test for all columns (with 3 or more LDFs pair)

* Correlations within the triangle if more than $0.1 m + \sqrt{m}$ pairs are correlated

* m = # of pair tested

### Implication 6: No High of Low Diagonals {#venter-imp-6}

Run regression that includes a variable for each diagonal

Each $q(w,d)$ is regressed against the cumulative losses at the prior period + dummy variable for which diagonal it is in

* $q(w,d) ~ c(w,d-1) + diagonal_{year}$

* If diagonal significatly high or low $\Rightarrow$ Dummy variable should have a statistically significant coefficient

* Same criteria where it is significant if coefficient is double the $\sigma$

Deficiceny of this method is that the diagonal effect is additive

* More likely to see multiplicative impact. e.g. from inflation

* This can be implement with a regression on the logarithm of the losses

#### Diagonal Trend as Inflation

Model $q(w,d)$ with a diagonal parameter $w+d$

$\mathrm{E}[q(w,d)] = f(d)h(w)g(w+d)$

Model constant CY trend to reduce the parameters:

$g(w+d) = (1+j)^{w+d}$
