# ERA 2.5 Measuring Value in Reinsurance - Venter, Gluck, Brehm

Value of reinsurance

1) Provides stability
2) Frees up capital
3) Adds to the value of the firm

Quantify stability metrics

* [Based on reinsurance premium and expected recoveries](#stability-1)
* [Amount of protection](#stability-2)
* [Premium - loss](#stability-3)
* [Distributions](#stability-4)
* [Efficient frontier](#stability-5)

Reinsurance as capital, 2 metrics:

* Net Benefit = |$\Delta$Cost of Capital| - |Net Cost of Reinsurance|
    * Requires > 0
* $ROE = \dfrac{\text{Net Cost of Reinsurance}}{\Delta \text{Capital}}$
    * Requires < cost of capital
    
Capital can be based on [theoretical or practical](#change-in-cap) model
    
Accumulation risk: [as-if reserve](#as-if)

Measure the impact on the value of the firm

* Difficult to do but some [recent study](#study) results

## Introduction {#era2-5-intro}

Value of reinsurance

1) Provides stability
2) Frees up capital
3) Adds to the value of the firm

Naive calculation: Sum(cash flow over contract length)

* (-) Premium and reinstatement
* (+) Ceding comm and reinsurance loss

$\hookrightarrow$ Will always show reinsurance is a bad deal especially after discounting the cashflow

* Make sense since reinsurers need to make a profit
* Cases where it's "profitable" to the cedant, it'll either be repriced or the cedants results are really poor

## 1. Quantifying Stability and Its Value

Measuring the value of reinsurance is more than calculating the expected cashflow from the reinsurance program

Significant judgement is required to evaluate the cost-benefit tradeoff

Metrics to measure and value stability:

* Ratio and difference of $\text{Reinsurance Premium}$ and  $\operatorname{E}[Recovery]$

* Expected loss under different programs

* $Premium - \operatorname{E}[Loss]$ under different programs

    * $\sigma$, percentiles, whole distribution
    
    * Space needle view,
    
* Distribution of other metrics

    * cost benefit diagram, pre tax net income, combined ratio
    
* Efficient frontier charts

### Reinsurance Premium and Expected Recoveries

<a name="stability-1"></a>

**Metrics 1**: Ratio = $\dfrac{\operatorname{E}[Recovery]}{\text{Reinsurance Premium}}$

**Metrics 2**: Net Cost of Reinsurance = $\text{Reinsurance Premium} - \operatorname{E}[Recovery]$

* On a PV basis?

Notes:

* $\operatorname{E}[Recovery]$ is net of reinstatement premiums, typically based on simulation results

* Should gauge how significant the net cost of reinsurance is by comparing to the firm's expected earnings for the year

### Amount of Protection

<a name="stability-2"></a>

**Metrics 3**: Compare *expected net loss* $\forall$ programs

### Premium Less Expected Loss

<a name="stability-3"></a>

This is Net Premium - Net Expected Loss

**Metrics 4**: Compare $Premium - \operatorname{E}[Loss]$ $\forall$ programs

* Does not include expenses or investment income

**Metrics 5**: $\sigma_{Premium - \operatorname{E}[Loss]}$

* ***Caveat***: Can be lowered by removing favorable outcomes

**Metrics 6**: 1^st^ percentile (most favorable) $Premium - \operatorname{E}[Loss]$

**Metrics 7**: Worst simulated outcome $Premium - \operatorname{E}[Loss]$

* Might be too extreme to look at 1-in-25K (99.996%)

Notes:

* Here we are sticking to high percentile means bad, similar to how we used to look at loss, but flip it for looking at earnings

### Distribution Based

<a name="stability-4"></a>

**Density** of $Premium - \operatorname{E}[Loss]$

* Compare shapes for different programs

* See if it's giving up the upside and like how does the tail look

**CDF** of $Premium - \operatorname{E}[Loss]$

* Pick a percentile and read it across the graph to find the value at that percentile for each curve

* Look at the difference between different programs at each percentile

***

*Note on difference of distribution*:

* Event that generate a given percentile is different across programs

    * Reinsurance changes the order of the outcomes
    
* We are interested in the difference of the distributions

    * NOT interested in the distribution of differences (as it doesn't make sense?)
    
* Goal here is the choose a reinsurance program and its associated distribution $\Rightarrow$ More useful to look at the dist^n^ themselves

* Interested in the cost-benefit trade off, cost is the net cost of reinsurance and benefit is the protection against adverse deviation

***

**Space Needle View** on $Premium - \operatorname{E}[Loss]$

* Shows different percentiles

* Colored section is proportional to the probability that the result is in that range

* Easy to compare each quantile across programs

**Cost Benefit Diagram**

* Cost of reinsurance (for each program) vs loss @ each percentile

**Pre-Tax Net Income**

* Include expenses and investment income

* Look at value at each iterations of the sim (percentile)

* Get a perspective on overall profitability e.g. probability of negative earnings

**CDF** on Combined Ratio

* **Caveat**: Can give distorted results when the net premium is reduced due to significant ceded premium

    * Expense ratio will be higher due to lower net premium (denominator)
    
    * Can make results look worst for program that have big cession
    
### Efficient Frontier Charts

<a name="stability-5"></a>

Plot the risk metric vs return metric for different reinsurance structure options and at different percentile and then graph out the efficient frontier as well

* Plot increasing risk to the right so it looks more familiar

* Look for programs that are up and left along the efficient frontier with the lowest risk metric for a given return metric

Return metrics:

* Earnings

Risk metrics:

* Probability of making plan
* Probability of: surplus < 2 $\times RBC$; surplus < BCAR score supporting a target rating; Expected loss in a 10 year period, $TVaR_{90\%}$, exceeds a threshold level or surplus ($TVaR_{90\%}$ should not exceed 20% of surplus); x% drop in quarterly EPS

## 2. Reinsurance as Capital

Capital is held to pay for claims when the premium is not sufficient to do so

Highly variable results will require more capital  
$\Downarrow$  
Reinsurance reduce volatility of results $\Rightarrow$ reduce capital required  
$\Downarrow$  
Reinsurance can be thought of as borrowed capital

We value the reinsurance by the impact it has in reducing Capital, or Cost of Capital. We compare these reductions to the cost of the reinsurance

***

Measure the amount of capital reduction that the insurer receives from the reinsurance program

* Compare the **cost of capital reduction** from reinsurance program

**Metrics 1**

Net Benefit = |$\Delta$Cost of Capital| - |Net Cost of Reinsurance|

* Net benefit > 0 then accept

* **Net cost of reinsurance** = $\text{Reinsurance Premium} - \operatorname{E}[Recovery]$ on a PV basis

* Alt formula: Net benefit = Net Cost of Reinsurance - $\Delta$Cost of Capital

* Review other criteria when the dollar benefit is the same

***

**Metrics 2**

$ROE = \dfrac{\text{Net Cost of Reinsurance}}{\Delta \text{Capital}}$

* Compare return on equity

* We want $ROE$ **below** the cost of capital here and that lower is better since we are reducing capital

    * Think about it if you're going from the plan interested to gross, if the $ROE$ is lower you don't want to change so the current plan is better
    
### Change in Capital {.tabset}

<a name="change-in-cap"></a>

2 different methods to determine this change

#### Theoretical Models

A risk metric is selected as a proxy to represent the economic capital required e.g. $VaR$, $TVaR$, multiples of $VaR$, $XTVaR$, etc

The risk metric is measured for each reinsurance program and the $\Delta$ in capital can be measured against a base (bare or current)

Set the economic capital = Net Premium - Expenses - risk metric

ROE here is calculated as the $\dfrac{\Delta \text{Expected Income}}{\Delta \text{Capital}}$ <span style="color:red">Check this might be same</span>, again we want it to be low

#### Practical Models

Use capital requirements from rating agencies like BCAR, S&P, CAR, RBC, ICAR, etc

Typically use a multiple of a regulatory metric

Reinsurance reduces the capital required due to lower net premium and net reserves with a slight offset from increase counterparty risk

**Pros**: Easier to implement (no need to model loss dist^n^ and correlation)

**Cons**: Not as accurate because the measurement of risk is based on proxies and not the actual risk itself

* e.g. stop loss only have small impact on premium but can have large impact on a risk (like the tail) that the method might not pick up

Alternatively, model a year out and predict the probability of falling below certain thresholds $\Rightarrow$ Capital could be set so that the probability is lower

* But then we'll have to model the I/S and reinsurance structure and everything

### Marginal ROE

Compare the marginal cost of reinsurance to the marginal capital to judge the value of reinsurance

1) Pick a risk metric as proxy for capital required

2) Calculate marginal capital relative the current program

3) Calculate $\Delta$ NPV Net Benefit = $\Delta$ NPV Ceded Loss - $\Delta$ NPV Ceded Premium

4) Calculate $ROE = \dfrac{\Delta \text{NPV Net Benefit}}{\text{Marginal Capital}}$

5) Calculate after tax $ROE$

* Compare the $ROE$ <span style="color:red">Not sure high or low we want</span>

* Bare in mind that a high ROE is meaningless if the amount of capital you can invest is small

#### XTVaR

Might be better to look at a multiple of XTVaR at a lower percentile

* XTVaR is the unfunded part of TVaR

* VaR is a single point and can be volatile at high percentiles

### Accumulation Risk

So far we implicitly assumed that the capita is held for only 1 year

* Capital calculated was static without regard to how long it takes to run it down as claims are paid

* Capital needs to be held until all claims are paid

**Consider length of time that capital is held**

Look at "lifetime" amount of capital = capital for new business + capital to support all unpaid claims from prior years

Set the capital requirements based on premium and reserves

<a name="as-if"></a> **As-if Reserves**

Reserves on prior AYs maybe based on business that is different from this year's book

$\hookrightarrow$ Use "as-if" reserves for the capital calculation

* Calculate the reserves as if the company had been writing the same book the last several years (and only differ by inflation?)

* Important for long tailed lines where capital requirement for the accumulated o/s reserve can be much large than the requirement for new business

**2 advantages** for the "as-if" reserves

1) Measure the impact of accumulated risk caused by correlated factors

    * Likely means correlated factors that can influence all those accident years e.g. inflation, change in law

2) Alternative reinsurance programs can be applied to the premium and as‐if reserves, providing a valid measure of the accumulated risk and capital used over the full life of the AY

* Capital calculated for both new premium and the loss reserves is a surrogate for the PV of the capital required for the current book over its lifetime

***

When aggregating AYs, we get temporal risk (risk based on time) that affect all AYs at the same time e.g. severity trend and auto correlation of severity trend

Including all AYs create a bigger spread of possible outcomes

#### Capital Consumed

How much capital is needed to pay deficiencies

Plot PDF and CDF of capital consumed:

* Capital Consumed = - PV[Premium + Reserves - Losses - Expenses]

When modeling XoL we need to model severity trend

* As it impacts all open claims

* Payment pattern is important as claims that are open longer will have more severity trend applied

We can base the capital consumed on different risk metrics like VaR and TVaR

ROE = Expected Profit / Capital Consumed

We want to see increase in ROE <span style="color:red">Make sure understand why</span>

## 3. Reinsurance and Market Value

Measure the impact on the value of the firm instead of the impact on capital

* Don't know how this can be done

* Currently: we measure value of the stability that reinsurance provides by measuring the reduction in capital

* Next step: Measure the value of reinsurance by measuring the $\Delta$ in the value of the company

***

<a name="study"></a> Some conclusion from recent studies

* Insureds demand price discounts of 10-20 times the expected cost of an insurer default (EPD)

    * e.g. 0.5% default, expected cost = 100K if default $\Rightarrow$ EPD = 500 $\Rightarrow$ Discount demand = 500 $\times 10 or 20 = 5-10K

* 1% decrease in capital $\Rightarrow$ 1% loss in pricing level

* 1% increase in $\sigma_{earnings}$ $\Rightarrow$ 0.33% decrease in pricing level

* Rating upgrades is worth 3% of business growth

* Rating downgrades can drop business by 5-20%

## Conclusion

* Use cost-benefit analysis to compare reinsurance programs

    * Select metrics to determine the benefit of the reinsurance and compare to cost for each reinsurance programs
    
* Net cost of reinsurance = NPV of expected decrease in earnings from purchasing reinsurance = PV[Expected loss - Premium - Reinstatement + Commission]

* Combined ratio can be distorted due to expense ratio

* Stability is the simplest measure of benefit; but $\sigma$ can be misleading as they can be lowered by eliminating favorable results

* Useful to look at the differences of distributions from the reinsurance options

* Efficient frontier is useful

* If we can measure the increase of value of the firm that would be great

    * Increased earnings from reduced financing costs
    
    * Higher premium from better claims paying ratings
    
    * Can't do this right now so the substitute is to measure the reduction in capital requirements
    
* Value of reinsurance can be measures vs a cost of capital or vs capital (ROE)
