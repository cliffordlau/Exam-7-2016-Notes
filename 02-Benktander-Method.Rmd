# Credible Claims Reserve: The Benktander Method - T. Mack

Know the GB method formula (\@ref(prp:GB-method))and properties

* Recognize actual emergence faster

## Gunnar Benktander Method (GB)

```{proposition, GB-method, name = "Benktander Reserve"} 
Reserve under the Benktaner Method

$R_{GB} = q_kU_{BF}$

* $q_k = (1 - p_k)$ = % unpaid loss @ $k$

* $U_{BF} = C_k + q_kU_0$

* Weight on $U_0$ is $q_k^2$
```

```{remark}
Benktander recognizes actual emergence faster $\Rightarrow$ Less weight on the a-priori

* BF reduces the use of actual loss to the extent of the complement credibility

$\begin{align}
  U_{GB} &= (1-q_k)U_{CL} + q_kU_{BF} & \cdots (1)\\
  &= (1-q_k^2)U_{CL} + q_k^2 U_0 & \cdots (2)\\
\end{align}$

1. Crediblity weight $U_{BF}$ and $U_{CL}$

2. Crediblity weight $U_{CL}$ and a priori
```

### Method Comparison

Table: (\#tab:GB-CL-BF-Comp) Comparison of Ultimate Loss and Reserve for Different Methods

| Method | Ultimate ($U$) | Reserve ($R$) |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| Chain Ladder | $\dfrac{C_k}{p_k}$ | $q_k U_{CL} = q_k \dfrac{C_k}{p_k}$ |
| BF Method | $C_k + q_kU_0$ | $q_k U_0$ |
| GB Method | $C_k + q_kU_{BF}$ | $q_k U_{BF}$ |

```{theorem, GB-iterate}
For an arbitrary starting point $U^{(0)} = U_0$ and the iteration rule $R^{(m)} = q_k U^{(m)}$ and $U^{(m+1)} = C_k + R^{(m)}$, $m = 0, 1, 2, ...$ 

gives credibility mixtures

$$U^{(m)} = (1-q^m_k)U_{CL} + q^m_k U_0$$

$$R^{(m)} = (1-q^m_k)R_{CL} + q^m_k R_{BF}$$

between $BF$ and $CL$ which start at $BF$ and lead via $GB$ to $CL$ for $m= \infty$
```

### MSE

MSE of Benktander is almost as small as the MSE of the optimal credibility in most cases

$MSE(R_{GB}) < MSE(R_{BF})$

* When $p_k \in [0, 2c^*]$; $c^*$ is the optimal credibility

    * $R_{GB}$ doesn't have the lowet $MSE$ only when $p_k > 2c^*$

* Doesn't hold if $c^*$ is small and $p_k$ is large

```{remark}
$MSE(R_c) = \mathrm{E}[R_c - R]^2$

* $R_c = c R_{CL} + (1-c)R_{BF}$

* $R = U - C_k = C_n - C_k$

Where:

* $c = 0$ for $BF$

* $c = p_k$ for $GB$

* $c = c^*$ for optimal credibility where $c \in [0, 1]$
```

## Notation

$U =$ Ultimate Loss

$R =$ Estimate of Unpaid losses

$U_0 =$ a priori estimate of Ultimate Losses

$p_k =$ % of total losses **paid** at $k$

$q_k = 1 - p_k =$ %  of total losses **unpaid** a $k$

$C_k =$ Actual paid losses at $k$
