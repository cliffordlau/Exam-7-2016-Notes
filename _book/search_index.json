Model did accurately forecast the LR but indications were unpopular so ignored Op risk: What governance should be there around management’s decisions 25.1.3 Insurer Op Risk: Cycle Management Cycle management: Prudent management of u/w capacity as market pricing fluctuates in the u/w cycle Simply maintaining market share during soft markets increases the likelihood of impairment 3 questions to ask: Does the company have or need a proactive cycle management strategy Does the company know where in the cycle the market stands Are u/w-ers making decisions that are consistent with (1) and (2) 25.1.3.1 System Performance Perspective From a system performance perspective, company needs to be: Stable, available, reliable, and affordable Downgrade impacts the first 2 (stability, availability) Insolvent impacts the last 2 (reliability, affordability) 25.1.3.2 Cycle Management Areas impact by implementing cycle management: Planning, u/w, objective setting, incentive bonus Focus on the following to achieve meaningful process improvements: Intellectual Property Intangible and are time consuming to build but easy to destroy Experts in u/w, claims, finance, actuarial P/h info database Forecasting systems Market relationship Reputation Focus on retaining these core assets through cycle: Retain top talent, grow and develop their skills Maintain presence in core market channels Maintain consistent pattern of investment in IT and systems Underwriter Incentives Bonus should be based on u/w-er supporting the portfolio goals, which may include writing less business, and they should know that it won’t affect employment and bonus Market Overreaction Companies tend to overreact, taking prices too low and too high Companies with most capital during price-improvement phase will reap windfall profits, which will more than offset many years of small u/w losses Owner Education Owner/shareholders need to understand that some financial figures will be out of step with the market and does not appear healthy during soft markets: Premium volume \\(\\downarrow\\) Overhead expense ratio to premium \\(\\uparrow\\) 25.1.4 Additional Perspectives 25.1.4.1 Agency Theory Perespective Incentives of managers and u/w-ers of the firm are not always aligned with shareholders Rather than try to fund for this op risk, better to understand it: Giving management equity stakes \\(\\xrightarrow{\\text{Caveat}}\\) Manager too aggressive taking on more risk Equity is a large portion of management’s net worth \\(\\xrightarrow{\\text{Caveat}}\\) Too risk adverse Production incentives for u/w-ers \\(\\xrightarrow{\\text{Caveat}}\\) Sloppy u/w-ing or mispricing 25.1.4.2 Operational Risk Management in Banking and Manufacturing Risks that are common to all business Pension funding IT failure Other HR risks (loss of important staff, misdesign of comp program) Reputation risk Lawsuits 25.1.4.3 Control Self-Assessment (CSA) Definition from Institute of Internal Auditors A process through which internal control effectiveness is examined and assessed. The objective is to provide reasonable assurance that all business objectives will be met Objectives of internal control Reliability and integrity of information Compliance with policies, laws and regulations Safeguarding assets Economical and efficient use of resources Accomplishment of objectives and goals for operations or programs 25.1.4.4 Key Risk Indications (KRIs) Broad category of measures that monitor the activities and status of the control environment of an operational risk category Measured frequently Have threshold that lead to escalation Possible KRIs Production: retention ratio, rate/exposure Internal controls: audit results and frequency Staffing: turnover rate, premium/employee, training budget Claims: freq, sev 25.1.4.5 Six Sigma Tolerances for quality if \\(\\pm 3 \\sigma\\) based on manufacturing Applied in process improvement or predictive design of processes Useful in high volume processing Help identify and eliminate: inefficiencies, errors, overlaps, gaps in communication and coordination Insurance example: U/w-ing: exposure data verification, exposure data capture, classification Claims: coverage verification Reinsurance: treaty claim reporting, coverage verification, collateralization 25.1.4.6 Operational Risk Modeling Operational risk manager needs to decide if risk should be transferred or retained Steps for operational risk portfolio management: Identify exposure base for each risk source (premium, headcount, payroll) Measure the exposure level for each BU and risk source Estimate the loss potential per exposure for each op risk Step 2 + 3 = loss distn for each BU Estimate the impact of mitigation, process improvements, or risk transfer Requires significant expert opinion as there are no significant amount of loss data both before and after "],

Overcapacity; Accommodation Very High Technology Shift; Patents; Obsolescence Low Possibly innovation in distn Brand Erosion; Collapse Moderate Reputation for fair claims handling Competitor Global Rivals; Unique Competitors Moderate Predatory pricing from competitors Customer Priority Shift; Power; Concentration Moderate Bigger issue for large commercial insurance Project Failure of R&amp;D; IT; Business Development; M&amp;A High Insurers has long history of failed mergers; Low investment in IT Stagnation Flat or declining volume; Price declines High Highly correlated to the cycle; Companies will keep writing business to cover fixed expenses 25.2.2.4 Hertz and Thomas Risk Analysis: An input for the strategy development process, aiding strategy formulation, evaluation, choice and implementation No distinction is drawn between strategic risk analysis and strategy formulation Both are viewed as part of a iterative, adaptive and flexible policy dialogue process 25.2.3 Scenario Planning Effective strategic planning begins with scenario planning: Limited # of scenarios: each tells a story of how elements may interact with each other under different conditions Test for internal consistency and plausibility Explore joint impact of several variables and change multiple variables at one time Include subjective interpretation of factors that cannot be explicitly modeled Attempts to capture the richness of range of possibilities \\(\\Rightarrow\\) Lead the makers to consider changes they might otherwise ignore 25.2.3.1 Key Steps in Scenario Planning Process: Define scope: time frame, geography, market segment Identify major stakeholders: employees, owners, regulators, customers, competitors, suppliers Identify basic trends: their influence on organization Identify key uncertainties: leverage points of impact Construct initial scenario theme Check for consistency and plausibility: outcomes fit together? Develop learning scenarios: identify themes and naming scenarios Identify research needs: areas that need additional research Develop quantitative models: formalize some interactions in a quantitative model? Evolve toward decision scenarios: iterative process of reviewing scenarios with the goal of converging to test scenarios and generate new ideas 25.2.3.2 Insurance Example Scenarios will be less detailed than a typical strategy or plan document Traditional unilateral planning approach: Set planned premium and ELR based on current year LR, price trend, and loss trend Caveat: Not thinking through the possibility of a possible price decrease, where they might want to reduce premium volume instead of the inflexibility of making the planned premium volume Scenario planning: Allow u/w-ers to be flexible in their approach in the case prices are not as expected Must decide ahead of time: Range of scenarios Responses to those scenarios Plans must have enough detail to give them operational weight Advantages: Thinks through responses beforehand and can agree on best response ahead of time Saves time during a crisis Operational inertia is reduced, flexibility is built into the system 25.2.4 Advanced Scenario Planning &amp; ERM Model Expansion Expend into several LoBs Internal consistency requires coordination Need to model dependencies Responses will be politically charged, as limited u/w capacity must be allocated across the company Better to do this during planning than in the heat of a market crisis Stochastic Scenario Planning Generate stochastically simulated scenarios that have responses based on a set of rules Need to define goals e.g. profit or premium level etc Need to have downside constraints e.g. capital loss of x% with y% probability Need to determine the estimate environmental variables that define the state of the world e.g. size of market, price level, current market share, etc Define action rules that respond to environmental variables e.g. hold price, increase u/w capacity according to price adequacy levels 25.2.5 Agent-Based Modeling Agents can be competitors, customers, regulators Program each agent to respond to the state of the market Chase market share, focus on technical price, customer may reduce coverage if prices are high, etc Creates a complex system with emergent properties that describe the behavior of agents -->"]
