Relativity (for different limits) over time Relativity starts close to 1.00, and drops over time before reaching the ultimate relativity The losses limited at higher limits start with a very high relativity (close to 1.00), and take longer to come down Here they define \\(LDF_t = \\dfrac{S}{S_t}\\) (So severity LDFs, not sure what’s the implication) Proposition 7.1 \\[LDF_t^L = LDF_t \\dfrac{R^L}{R_t^L}\\] Proof. \\(LDF_t^L = \\dfrac{\\text{Ultimate Loss}}{\\text{Losses @ t}} = \\dfrac{C \\cdot S^L}{C_t \\cdot S^L_t} = \\dfrac{C \\cdot S \\cdot R^L}{C_t \\cdot S_t \\cdot R^L_t} = \\underbrace{\\dfrac{C \\cdot S}{C_t \\cdot S_t }}_{LDF_t} \\times \\dfrac{R^L}{R^L_t} = LDF_t \\dfrac{R^L}{R_t^L}\\) Remark. \\(C\\) is claim count and \\(S\\) is severity Proposition 7.2 \\[^{XS}LDF_t^L = LDF_t \\dfrac{(1-R^L)}{(1-R_t^L)}\\] Remark. Analogous relationship for XS LDFs Proposition 7.3 \\[LDF_t = R^L_t \\cdot LDF^L_t + (1 - R^L_t) \\cdot {^{XS}LDF}^L_t\\] Remark.

Difference of limited and unlimited incremental LDFs is driven by the change in relativity With \\(R_t\\) and \\(R_{t+1}\\) we can get the limited or unlimited LDF given one or the other Proposition 7.5 \\[\\dfrac{_{inc}^{XS}LDF^L_t}{_{inc}LDF_t} = \\Delta (1 - R^L_t) = \\dfrac{1 - R^L_{t+1}}{1 - R^L_t}\\] "],
