We assume each of the \\(\\left( \\dfrac{c_{i,k+1}}{c_{i,k}} \\right)\\) are an unbiased estimate of \\(f_k\\) From assumption 1 &amp; 2? \\(\\therefore\\) Any weighting of them is also unbiased Remark. When we use weighted volume average \\(w_{i,k} = \\dfrac{c_{i,k}}{\\sum \\limits_{j} c_{j,k}}\\) The weights that minimize the variance is inversely proportional to the variance of the item we are estimating We want weights \\(w_{i,k}\\) for each \\(i\\) on \\(\\left( \\dfrac{c_{i,k+1}}{c_{i,k}} \\right)\\) The weight we apply to each \\(\\left( \\dfrac{c_{i,k+1}}{c_{i,k}} \\right)\\) varies based on the variance of \\(\\left( \\dfrac{c_{i,k+1}}{c_{i,k}} \\right)\\) And if \\(\\left( \\dfrac{c_{i,k+1}}{c_{i,k}} \\right)\\) has high variance its weight will be lower to minimize the total variance of our estimate of \\(\\hat{f}_k = \\left( \\dfrac{c_{1,k+1}}{c_{1,k}} \\right) \\times w_{1,k} + \\cdots + \\left( \\dfrac{c_{I,k+1}}{c_{I,k}} \\right) \\times w_{I,k}\\) High variance estimate get lower weight: \\[\\dfrac{1}{w_{i,k}} \\propto \\mathrm{Var}\\left( \\dfrac{c_{i,k+1}}{c_{i,k}} \\right)\\] Since \\(c_{i,k}\\) is known, we can pull it out of the variance term \\[\\dfrac{1}{w_{i,k}} \\propto \\dfrac{\\mathrm{Var}(c_{i,k+1})}{c_{i,k}^2}\\] and we get \\[\\begin{equation} w_{i,k} \\times \\mathrm{Var}(c_{i,k+1}) \\propto c_{i,k}^2 \\tag{4.2} \\end{equation}\\] Recall the weight for the volume weighted average is: \\[\\begin{align} w_{i,k} &amp;= \\dfrac{c_{i,k}}{\\sum \\limits_{j} c_{j,k}}\\\\ w_{i,k} &amp;\\propto c_{i,k}\\\\ \\end{align}\\] Applying the above to equation (4.2) we get: \\[\\begin{align} c_{i,k} \\times \\mathrm{Var}(c_{i,k+1}) &amp;\\propto c_{i,k}^2 \\\\ \\mathrm{Var}(c_{i,k+1}) &amp;\\propto c_{i,k} \\\\ \\mathrm{Var}(c_{i,k+1}) &amp;= \\alpha^2_k \\times c_{i,k} \\\\ \\end{align}\\] And we have chainladder assumption 3 (Prop. 4.3) 4.1.3 LDF Selections Assumptions Recall equation (4.1) and (4.2) Table 4.1: Relationships between weight, variance and residual Weight \\(w_{i,k}\\) Description Variance Residual (4.9) 1 Simple Average \\(\\alpha_k^2 \\times \\mathbf{c_{i,k}^2}\\) \\(\\varepsilon_{i,k} = \\dfrac{c_{i,k+1} - c_{i,k} \\: \\hat{f_k}}{\\sqrt{\\mathbf{c_{i,k}^2}}}\\) \\(c_{i,k}\\) Weighted Average \\(\\alpha_k^2 \\times \\mathbf{c_{i,k}}\\) \\(\\varepsilon_{i,k} = \\dfrac{c_{i,k+1} - c_{i,k} \\: \\hat{f_k}}{\\sqrt{\\mathbf{c_{i,k}}}}\\) \\(c_{i,k}^2\\) Least Square2 \\(\\alpha_k^2 \\times \\mathbf{1}\\) \\(\\varepsilon_{i,k} = \\dfrac{c_{i,k+1} - c_{i,k} \\: \\hat{f_k}}{\\sqrt{\\mathbf{1}}}\\) Note the least square here we are forcing the intercept through the origin Assumption for LS is that variance is the same for each exposure year (See Brosius) Use different method for LDF selection based on variance assumption Variance and the weight always multiply to \\(c_{j,k}^2\\) 4.1.4 Violation of Assumptions Correlation between on AYs and another Assumption 2 (Prop. 4.2) is violated Not necessarily assumption 1 (Prop. 4.1) e.g. Strong calendar year effects (i.e. faster payment, changing inflation) will lead to correlation along a diagonal Check using calendar year test A single \\(\\hat{f}_k\\) is not appropriate for all years \\(i\\) Assumption 1 (Prop. 4.1) is violated Dependence among columns Assumption 1 (Prop. 4.1) is violated Not necessarily assumption 2 (Prop. 4.2) If losses in the follow period are inversely correlated to the losses in the current period, then we’ll have correlation between adjacent LDFs but still maintain independence of AYs If residuals are not random around zero Assumption 3 (Prop. 4.3) is violated If we see any trends or change in magnitude Check with residual test 4.1.5 Strength/Weakness of Chainladder Weakness Tail LDFs depend on very few observations High variability in the reported claims in the most recent years lead to uncertainty \\(c_{I,1} = 0\\) \\(\\Rightarrow\\) \\(\\hat{R}_{I,1} = 0\\), which is not reasonable Results need to be judged by someone who knows the business under consideration Unexpected future changes can make the observations obsolete Strength User knows exactly how the method works and it’s weakness Can be easily explained to non-actuaries "],
