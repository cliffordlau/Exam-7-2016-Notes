Difficulty with actuary convincing management to post the appropriate reserve Standard techniques requires: Homogeneous book, sufficient frequency, and detailed exposure info (Problems 3, 4, 5); Difficult to supplement with industry info Side note on tax impact, reinsurer liabilities are much longer tail than primary and there for the discounted liabilities are smaller and will incur greater income tax "],

Facultative casualty: breakdown by automatic primary programs (pro rata share of group-up exposure) vs automatic nonprimary programs (excess) Certificate exposure should ideally be split by attachment point range Or at least buffer vs umbrella layer and then further by primary line For property and other exposure: split by pricing categories Need to balance homogeneity with credibility of data Review loss statistics and reporting pattern to see if data is still credible Leverage u/w-er, claim handlers and data processors to determine which variables are the most important 13.3.2 Step (2) &amp; (3): Analyze Historical Data and Projection Backward looking of historical data (Step 2): Analyze the historical development patterns. If possible, consider individual case reserve development and the emergence of IBNR claims separately Use long periods where practical and curve fit where practical Forward looking and projection (Step 3): Estimate the future development.
