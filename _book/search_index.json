Operational and strategic risks are less amenable to quantitative modeling 16.2.3 Enterprise Risk Model Process Diagnose \\(\\Rightarrow\\) Analyze \\(\\Rightarrow\\) Implement \\(\\Rightarrow\\) Monitor \\(\\Rightarrow\\) Repeat 16.2.3.1 Diagnose High level risk assessment All risks are considered Include preliminary development of thresholds for risk that will be considered material of significant (e.g. Key aspect 3) from above) Table below 16.1 can serve as a structured way to analyze the pillars of the risk taxonomy Table 16.1: Categorization of uncertainties General Environment Industry Firm Specific Political uncertainties (e.g. democratic changes, war, revolution) Input market (e.g. supply, quality) Operating (e.g. labor, supply) Government policy (e.g. fiscal, monetary changes, regulation) Product market (e.g. demand) Liability (e.g. products, employment, production) Marcoeconomic environment (e.g. inflation, interest rates) Competitive uncertainties (e.g. new entrants, rivalry) R&amp;D Social (e.g. terrorism) Credit Natural (e.g. cat events) Behavioral 16.2.3.2 Analyze Analyze risk identified in step 1 for materiality and prioritize Critical Risk: Risk with potential to exceed the company’s threshold They should be modeled to the extent possible Preferably quantified with a probability distribution of outcomes Correlations among risk factors must be recognized (distribution integrated across the various risk silos) Risk metrics are calculated with the combined distribution to establish a measure of the degree of risk Selected risk measures must be consistent with management’s view toward risk Prioritize risk factors that contribute to adverse scenarios (or risk metrics) above the critical threshold 16.2.3.3 Implement Focus on managing risks identified and analyzed as material 5 potential actions to manage risk: Avoidance Reduction in chance of occurrence Mitigate effect given occurrence Eliminate or transfer of the consequences Retention (by desing of default) some or all of the risk Speculative risk factor may provide an opportunity to capitalize on the risk, rather than manage it away Perform a cost/benefit or risk/return trade-off analysis 16.2.3.4 Monitor Management need to monitor the process, compare to expectations Need to update plans and model as company or market or competitors change (not a “project” to be completed) New risk to address New ways to control them New options for treating or transferring risk "],
["ermodel-overview-era1.html", "16.3 ERA 1.3 Enterprise Risk Modeling Overview", " 16.3 ERA 1.3 Enterprise Risk Modeling Overview Goal: understand and quantify the relationships among the risks to the business that arise from asset, liabilities and underwriting All are affected by internal decisions &amp; external factors Modeling can help with management functions and strategic decisions: Determining capital need (to support riks, maintain rating, etc) Identifying sources of significant risk and cost of capital to support them Setting reinsurance strategies Planning growth Managing asset mix Valuing companies for M&amp;A 16.3.1 Quality of Models Good Model: Show the balance between risk and reward for a range of different strategies (e.g. changing asset mix or reinsurance program or LoB to grow) Recognizes and reflects its own imperfection (Model only approximates reality and the parameters are uncertain) Weak Model: Over(under)state risks \\(\\leadsto\\) Overly cautious (aggressive) choices Things that affect the suitability and usefulness of the model Data quality Choices on assumptions and mathematical method Variety of different risk elements and how they are represented Key elements that differentiate model quality: Model: Reflects relative importance of various risks to business decisions Includes mathematical techniques to reflect dependencies Modelers: Have a deep knowledge of the fundamentals of those risks Have a trusted relationship with senior management Model should take into account the uncertainty from other models (e.g. CAT, ESG, credit risk) that are used as inputs Risks less amenable to detailed representation in enterprise risk model (Non-quantifiable risk): e.g. Op risk (IT exposures, pension inadequacy, key man risk, rogue traers, frade) They are extremely important to the success of a business Requires specialized management process and difficult to incorporate into an overall risk model Can be modeled in bulk using informed judgements (but with high degree of uncertainty) Use model to manage the risk for which the modeling process is effective While some risks are at best weakly represented in such a model and requires other management methods 16.3.2 Key Elements of ERM Underwriting Risk Reserving Risk Asset Risk Dependencies (Correlation) 16.3.2.1 Underwriting Risk Loss Frequency and Severity Distribution Use statistical methods to: Estimate parameters Test quality of fit Understand uncertainties that remain Common distributions for insurance loss are available in many papers Transformed Beta and Gamma Distributions and Aggregate Losses - Venter Continuous Distributions - Kreps Pricing Risk Instability from variations in the premiums as well as losses Misestimation of projected losses as well as competitive market pressures Deficiency may exist for many years for long tailed lines \\(\\Rightarrow\\) Accumulation of reserve deficiency Model should include u/w cycle as it contributes significantly to pricing risk See additional details in ERA 5.2 Parameter Risk: Misestimated parameters, imperfect form and risk not modeled (Likely largest risk net of reinsurance (larger than cat exposure)) Estimation Risk: Error in estimatins the form and parameters Depends on available data (i.e. more and better data reduces this risk) Projection Risk: Error on forecast of future value even if we fit the historical data accurately Examples: Freq/Sev trend from the time of the data to the current and future underwriting periods Developemen of ultimate losses Affected by macro factors (e.g. inflation) and the coresponding dependencies should be reflected in the model Unexpected change in external risk conditions also add to projection risk, e.g. Lower fuel price \\(\\Rightarrow\\) Increased driving Long term shift to more extreme weather Event Risk: Causal link between a large unpredictable event and losses to an insurer Example: Court ruling that favors a large group of policyholders (e.g. class action) Exposure that existed, unknown, for many years comes to light (e.g. asebestos) New cause of loss emerges that was previously regarded as not covered (e.g. environmental, CD) Regulator or court expands coverage by barring important exclusions New entrant into market reduces rates to grab market share Systematic Risk: Operates simultaneously on a large number of policies Undiversifiable, i.e. do not improve with added volume e.g. macro factors such as inflation See additional detail in ERA 3.2 Catastrophe Modeling Uncertainty Exposure to natural and man-made cat Likely largest risk after parameter risk, special case of parameter risk Based on proprietary cat models, further source of uncertaity Differences between commercial models and different versions of the same model Considerable amount of uncertainty in the probabilities of various events and the amount of insured damange Additional uncertainty from data quality Mismatches of company data fields and cat model assumptions Can quantified by the use of more than one model for each peril Cat distributions are subject to the same considerations of parameter risk and correlation as other risk distributions 16.3.2.2 Reserving Risk Adverse development can be significant for long tailed lines \\(\\uparrow\\) reserve uncertainty \\(\\Rightarrow\\) \\(\\uparrow\\) capital requirement &amp; \\(\\uparrow\\) time holding the capital Model needs to capture both process variance and parameter risk Key aspects of risk modeling process Specifying the reserve runoff model Testing it with quality of fit measures Unearned premium reserve should be modeled in underwriting risk 16.3.2.3 Asset Risk Need to focus on issues of the specific markets that the company operates Main asset classes: equities, fixed income, real estate Different types of fixed income are important in different regions FX and inflation are closely related to asset modeling as well Asset Modeling: Probabilistic Reality Modeling scenarios consistent with historical patterns Generate a large variety of scenarios against which to test the insurer’s strategy Scenarios are weighted by probability Scenarios should be reasonable when compared to historical patterns Asset liability matching Offset between insurance risk and investment risk P&amp;C companies can opt for longer duration assets and not match the liabilities to increase investment return while still maintain reasonable ALM risk Need to consider that P&amp;C liabilities are inflation sensitive as well Or if liabilities are carried at PV marked to current interest rate Efficient Frontier: \\(\\sigma\\) vs \\(\\operatorname{E}[Return]\\) See how it changes by modifying reinsurance structure or asset mix More details in ERA 2.4 Modeling Considerations Bonds: Model with arbitrage free models Should capture historical features of bond markets (high auto-correlations and distribution of yield spreads) Equities: Incorporate correlations with bonds Geometric Brownian motion model with additional volatility is more realistic (Allow for more extreme motion or even discontinuities) FX: First model interest rates of the currencies then model the FX rates Changes in actual and anticipated interest rates in two countries lead to changes in the FX rates Interest rate movements across different economies are correlated as well 16.3.2.4 Dependencies Important to capture dependencies or else the model will be unrealistically stable Sources of Dependencies: Macro econ conditions, affect many risks. Use ESG U/w cycle, loss trends and reserve development can impact across lines CAT and other extreme events like the 2008 financial crisis Difficult to quantify Use copulas to capture different forms of dependency Correlation is too simplistic and does not capture the dependencies in the tail 16.3.3 Setting Capital Requirements Policyholders wants more capital \\(\\Leftrightarrow\\) Shareholders want higher return (less capital) Set capital to maximize insurer’s value \\(\\Rightarrow\\) Unifies the competing requirements of prudence and efficiency Approaches to set capital requirements: 1. Default Avoidance: Focused on the tail and protecting policyholders Caveat: S/h will be hurt at much lower loss amount We have the least confidence in the tail of the model \\(\\hookrightarrow\\) More feasible and relevant to focus on thresholds less extreme than default 2. Lower Threshold than Probability of Ruin: Probability of downgrade Significant loss \\(\\leadsto\\) \\(\\downarrow\\) financial rating \\(\\leadsto\\) \\(\\downarrow\\) franchise value &gt; loss itself Sufficient capital to service renewals Survive and thrive after major CAT 16.3.4 Convert Probability to Loss Converting Probability Levels to Financial Loss Amounts Smallest amount of loss, \\(\\alpha \\%\\) of the time \\(\\Rightarrow\\) \\(VaR_{100 - \\alpha \\%}\\) Average loss, \\(\\alpha \\%\\) of the time \\(\\Rightarrow\\) \\(TVaR_{100 - \\alpha \\%}\\) 1-in-\\(x\\) years event loss no more than \\(y \\%\\) of capital \\(\\Rightarrow\\) \\(\\dfrac{100}{y} \\times TVaR_{1 - \\frac{1}{x}}\\) Important: Risk measures do not tell us how much capital to hold; They tell us for a given level of capital, what the risk to the company is 16.3.5 Risk Adjusted Performance Allocate capital to business units \\(\\Rightarrow\\) Calculate the rate of return \\(\\dfrac{\\text{Profit}}{\\text{Capital}}\\) for that unit \\(\\Rightarrow\\) Compare RoR across BUs Can also allocate risk capital to investments \\(\\Rightarrow\\) Compare riskiness of investments and u/w Need to make sure risk measures are consistent -->"]
