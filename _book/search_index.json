["introduction.html", "14.1 Introduction", " 14.1 Introduction Definition 14.1 Premium Asset (3 definitions) On retrospectively rate policies, premium that the insurer expects to collect based on the expected ultimate loss experience less the premium that the insurer has already booked, or Earned But Not Reported Premium (EBNR) ,or Asset supported by premium the insurer expect to collect from clients with retrospective policies as losses develops Remark. Admitted portion of the premium asset appears on the balance sheet as the “Asset for Accrued Retrospective Premiums” Background: Retrospective policies were popular in 1996: For insured: Returns premium to insured for good experience Cashflow: Premiums are due with short lag to losses, as opposed to upfront For insurer: Allows insurer to attracts good customers that expect to see favorable loss experience through loss control and loss management Allows an insurance company to shift a significant portion of the risk to the insured (Uncertainty due to inflation, rate regulations, uncertainty in claims compensation, increase utilization of the insurance benefits, growing attorney involvement) Estimating the premium asset was needed for many commercial lines insurers as this asset frequency exceeds 10% of surplus 14.1.1 Discussion of Berry and Fitzgibbon Method Method for calculating retro reserve [Premium deviation to date] - [Ultimate premium deviation] Definition 14.2 \\[\\dfrac{\\text{Ultimate Premium}}{\\text{Standard Premium}}\\] Ultimate Premiums Deviation: Amount by which the ultimate premium for a retro rated policy is expected to differ from the standard premium (manual premium w/ adj for experience) Premium deviation to date: Amount by which the currently booked premium differs from the standard premium Fitzgibbon Method: Analyze the historical relationship between the loss ratio and the premium deviation using statistical techniques Apply the relationship to the projected loss ratio to calculate the projected ultimate premium deviation Retro reserve = [Ultimate premium deviation] - [Premium deviation to date] Berry Method: Estimate ultimate premium with historical premium emergence pattern Subtract estimated ultimate premium by current premium Caveat: Lack intuitive appeal Methods do not consider how a retro rating formula actually works i.e. premium is a function of loss, with retro rating parameters such as the loss conversion factor, tax multiplier, retro min/max \\(\\therefore\\) Premium asset should be establish as a function of reported loss and the reserve for loss development Where the function is defined by the retro rating parameters "],

Disadvantage for the insurer since the client doesn’t finish paying their premium for several years No loss development is baked into formula (14.1) so the premium estimate at the first several valuations are likely too low 14.3.2 Calculating PDLD \\[\\begin{equation} PDLD = \\dfrac{\\Delta P}{\\Delta L} \\sim \\dfrac{d P}{d L} \\tag{14.2} \\end{equation}\\] Relationship between premium development and loss development Apply to expected loss development to determine the expected premium development \\(L\\) here is not capped \\[\\begin{equation} PDLD_n = \\dfrac{P_n - P_{n-1}}{L_n - L_{n-1}} \\tag{14.3} \\end{equation}\\] 14.3.2.1 Estimating First Period PDLD First adjustment includes Basic Premium (\\(BP\\)) \\(\\Rightarrow\\) Requires different treatment from the other adjustments Important formulas below \\[\\begin{equation} PDLD_1 =\\underbrace{\\left(\\frac{BP}{SP} \\right)}_{\\text{Basic Prem Factor}} \\frac{TM}{ELR \\cdot \\%Loss_1} + \\underbrace{\\left( \\frac{CL_1}{L_1}\\right)}_{\\text{Loss Capping Ratio}} \\cdot LCF \\cdot TM \\tag{14.4} \\end{equation}\\] Loss capping ratio is estimated base on the actual losses and the structure of the contract The formula above (14.4) is too responsive to actual losses in the first period, as only a portion of the formula is related to the \\(L_1\\) as shown below \\[\\begin{equation} P_1 = \\underbrace{\\left( \\frac{BP}{SP} \\right) \\frac{TM}{ELR \\cdot \\%Loss_1}}_{\\text{Not }\\propto\\text{ Loss}_1} \\times \\operatorname{E}[L_1] + \\underbrace{\\left( \\frac{CL_1}{L_1} \\right) \\cdot LCF \\cdot TM}_{\\propto \\text{ Loss}_1} \\times L_1 \\tag{14.5} \\end{equation}\\] So technically only the 2nd part of the formula should be applied to \\(L_1\\) while the first part is in relation to the \\(\\mathrm{E}[L_1]\\) Note that \\(SP = \\dfrac{\\text{Expected Loss}}{ELR}\\) Use this formula to address the issue of over responsive Remark. Basic premium factor vs charge Basic Premium Factor = \\(\\dfrac{BP}{SP}\\) Used by Teng Perkins Basic Premium Charge = \\(\\dfrac{BP}{SP} \\cdot TM\\) Used by Feldblum 14.3.2.2 Estimating Subsequent PDLD \\[\\begin{equation} \\begin{array}{cccl} PDLD_n &amp;= &amp;\\left(\\dfrac{CL_n - CL_{n-1}}{L_n - L_{n-1}}\\right) &amp;\\cdot \\: LCF \\cdot TM \\:\\:\\:\\:\\text{For }n&gt;1\\\\ &amp;= &amp;\\left(\\dfrac{\\Delta CL}{\\Delta L}\\right) &amp;\\cdot \\: LCF \\cdot TM\\\\ \\end{array} \\tag{14.6} \\end{equation}\\] \\(LCF\\) and \\(TM\\) are known at policy inception so we only have to estimate the loss capping ratio \\(\\dfrac{\\Delta CL}{\\Delta L}\\) \\(LCF\\) is smaller at older ages (since more large losses developed and capped) This equation is basically the 2nd part of (14.4) "],
