Bare in mind that a high ROE is meaningless if the amount of capital you can invest is small 21.3.2.1 XTVaR Might be better to look at a multiple of XTVaR at a lower percentile XTVaR is the unfunded part of TVaR \\[XTVaR_{\\alpha} = \\mathrm{E}[Y \\mid F(Y) &gt; \\alpha] - \\mathrm{E}[Y]\\] VaR is a single point and can be volatile at high percentiles 21.3.3 Accumulation Risk So far we implicitly assumed that the capital is held for only 1 year Capital calculated so far was static without regard to how long it takes to run it down as claims are paid Capital needs to be held until all claims are paid 21.3.3.1 “Life-time” Amount of Capital \\[\\begin{align} \\text{&quot;Lifetime&quot; amount of capital} \\:\\: = \\:\\: &amp; \\text{Capital for new business} \\\\ &amp;+ \\text{Capital to support all unpaid claims from prior years} \\\\ \\end{align}\\] \\(\\therefore\\) Set the capital requirements based on premium and reserves Caveat: Current reserves may be based on business that is different from this year’s book (e.g. size, mix of business, etc) Use “as-if” reserves for capital calculation Definition 21.10 (As-if Reserves) Calculate the reserves as if the company had been writing the same book the last several years Adjust for inflation Especialy important for long tailed lines where capital requirement for the accumulated outstanding reserve can be much large than the requirement for new business Focus here is to determine the impacts on capital so we can assign a cost to each reinsurance program When comparing reinsurance program, the reserves would be calculated under each reinsurance program Capital calculated for both the new premium, and the loss reserves is a surrogate for the PV of the capital required for the current book over its lifetime 2 Advantages for the “as-if” reserves Measure the impact of accumulated risk caused by correlated factors Likely means “correlated risk factors” that can influence all those accident years (e.g. inflation, change in law) Alternative reinsurance programs can be applied to the premium and as‐if reserves, providing a more valid measure of the accumulated risk and capital used over the full life of the AY When aggregating AYs, we get temporal risk (risk based on time) that affect all AYs at the same time (e.g. severity trend and auto correlation of severity trend) Including all AYs create a bigger spread of possible outcomes 21.3.4 Capital Consumed Concept: How much capital is needed to pay deficiencies Plot/compare PDF and CDF of Capital Consumed: \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{Capital Consumed} = - PV[\\text{Premium} + \\text{Reserves} - \\text{Losses} - \\text{Expenses}] \\tag{21.1} \\end{equation}\\] Apply Reinsurance Example When modeling XoL contracts we need to model severity trend Severity trend impacts all open claims Payment pattern is important as claims that are open longer will have more severity trend applied We can base the capital consumed on different risk measures (e.g. VaR and TVaR) \\[ROE = \\dfrac{\\text{Expected Profit}}{\\text{Capital Consumed}}\\] Do we want increase or decrease ROE?
