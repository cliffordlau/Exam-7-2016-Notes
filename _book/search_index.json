Single deterministic forecast of cash flow Return metric using NPV or IRR Sensitivity test on inputs (e.g. revenue, expense, cost of capital) Sensitivity doesn’t have any probabilities assigned for each scenarios Uncertainty is handled judgmentally 17.1.2 Risk Analysis Figure 17.2: Risk Analysis Remark. Critical inputs have a distribution (w/ correlations) \\(\\hookrightarrow\\) Output is a distribution of NPV or IRR Uncertainty is handled judgmentally (Good portion has been moved into the distn) 17.1.2.1 Reason to Stay in Step 2 Argument that step 2 is sufficient (Current best practice 2007): Since investors are only compensated for systemic risk and not firm specific risk, no need to focus on firm specific risk Based on portfolio theory where investors holds many different firm so the firm specific risk are diversified away \\(\\therefore\\) Only need to manage systemic risk Counter argument: Management can’t distinguish between systemic and firm risk Risk-adjusted discount rate reflect risk only if there is a time lag For many kinds of risk the time aspect is unimportant (Risk is instantaneous - jump risk) Jump risk is still present as information have a time lag Market based information is lack the refinement and discriminatory power (too noisy) for management to be able to do proper cost-benefit analysis and make trade off decisions 17.1.3 Certainty Equivalent Figure 17.3: Certainty Equivalent Remark. Distribution output from risk analysis is input to a utility function for the firm Utility function is based on corporate risk policy Purpose is to express preference in a transparent and consistent manner \\(\\hookrightarrow\\) Automate and formalizes some of the risk assessment, while risk judgement is still required 17.1.3.1 Reason to Move to Step 3 Risk managers and shareholders are both interested in preserving franchise value \\(\\hookrightarrow\\) Want risk management in place to protect franchise value \\(\\hookrightarrow\\) Both should support policies to help make risk management more objective, consistent, repeatable, and transaparent \\(\\therefore\\) Provides some degree of support for evolution to step 3 Market Value = Book Value + Franchise Value Franchise Value = Value of future earnings growth "],
