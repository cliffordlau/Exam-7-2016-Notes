(“Implication of Reinsurance and Reserves on Risk on Investment Asset Allocation”) 1) Assets (No Liabilities) Porfolio Short term treasures: risk free and maintain value well Long bond and stocks are risky Use modern portfolio theory to find alternatives on the efficient frontier 2) Known Liabilities and Known Cash Flows (Fixed in Time and Amount) Investment duration: Short duration \\(\\Rightarrow\\) Reinvestment risk Long duration \\(\\Rightarrow\\) Interest rate risk Risk and conclusions are different if liabilities are discounted at current rates (Such as using Economic balance sheet) 3) Liabilities are Variable and Timing is Variable Precise matching is impossible Requires model that incorporate asset and liability fluctuations Inflation sensitive liabilities further complicates things 4) Going Concern Company, with Cash Flow from Current Operations Can have positive or negative cash flow If asset prices are too low, can pay claims from premium cash flows and use depreciated assets to support loss reserves Need to model: premium, income, losses, cat losses, expenses Need enterprise wide model with holistic view to handle the complexity 20.2.1 Additional Consideration: Tax Investment strategy change in responses to u/w cycle Profitable period: Tax exempt bonds are better Unprofitable period: Taxable bonds are better as the investment income is reduced by u/w losses Assets is also reallocated to maximize income while avoiding Alternative Minimum Tax 20.2.2 Additional Consideration: Equity Generally considered risky and imply a potentially worst downside risk to capital However, they can be useful hedge against inflation Can be tested with an ERModel, but conclusions will be sensitive to input assumptions of the macroeconomic model 20.2.3 VFIC 2002 Published by CAS’ Valuation, Finance &amp; Investment Committee (VFIC) Testing the optimality of duration matching assets &amp; liabilities Simulation models were used against the following scenarios: Long tailed business vs short tailed business (w/ CAT) Profitable vs unprofitable (Generate cash and consumes cash) Growing vs shrinking companies Results were reviewed on GAAP, Stat, Economic B/S basis and several risk measures were used form each accounting basis: Duration matching was one of the optimal strategies Investment choice depends on: Risk metrics selected Return metrics (Venter used US GAAP pretax \\(\\Delta\\) in surplus) Risk tolerance or preference Results for Economic Balance Sheet: Assets are mark to market, liabilities are discounted at current rates Duration match results in low interest rate risk Longer duration is better if not matched: Long duration investments: \\(\\uparrow\\) interest rate risk \\(\\uparrow\\) returns Short duration investments: \\(\\uparrow\\) reinvestment rate risk and \\(\\downarrow\\) return Choosing longer duration vs matching is a value judgement (i.e. is the extra return worth the extra risk) Other Remarks: Duration match is irrelevant for Stat and GAAP accounting as they are not responsive to interest rate movement Adding cash flows from continuing operations complicates this analysis "],
