["bay-cred.html", "1.3 Bayesian Credibility", " 1.3 Bayesian Credibility We can’t use the Bayes theorem as in the previous section if we don’t know the underlying distribution Proposition 1.4 Estimate the ultimate losses using the best linear estimator of Y|X, \\(L(x)\\) \\(L(x) = (x - \\mathrm{E[X]})\\dfrac{Cov(X,Y)}{Var(X)} + \\mathrm{E[Y]}\\) Y = Ultimate Losses; X = Reported Losses Use this when we don’t know the distribution of the random variable \\(L(x) = Q(x)\\) when \\(Q(x)\\) is linear Remark. This is like the Bühlmann method, where \\(L\\) is a linear function that minimizes \\(\\mathrm{E}_X\\left[\\left(Q(X) - L(X)\\right)^2\\right]\\) If \\(L(x) = a + b x\\) then we minimize \\(\\mathrm{E}_X\\left[\\left(Q(X) - a - bX \\right)^2\\right]\\) Table 1.2: Intuitive interpretation of \\(L(x)\\) Scenarios Implications Interpretation \\(x = \\mathrm{E[X]}\\) \\(L(X) = \\mathrm{E[Y]}\\) Losses are coming in as expected, estimate of ultimate losses is unchanged \\(\\mathrm{Cov(X,Y)} \\approx 0\\) \\(L(X) \\cong \\mathrm{E[Y]}\\) \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are only loosely related \\(\\Rightarrow\\) Use ELR Method \\(\\mathrm{Cov(X,Y)} \\ll \\mathrm{Var(X)}\\) \\(L(X) \\cong \\mathrm{E[Y]}\\) \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) don’t vary together \\(\\mathrm{Cov(X,Y)} \\approx \\mathrm{Var(X)}\\) \\(L(X) \\approx x + \\left[\\mathrm{E}[Y] - \\mathrm{E}[X] \\right]\\) Same as BF Method \\(\\mathrm{Cov(X,Y)} \\gg \\mathrm{Var(X)}\\) \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) move together, \\(Y\\) is significantly influenced by \\(X\\) Use Dev Method 1.3.1 Practical Application (LS Development) Proposition 1.5 (Development Formula 1) Estimate \\(\\mathrm{E}[X]\\), \\(\\mathrm{Var}(X)\\), and \\(\\mathrm{Cov}(X,Y)\\) from data (i.e. a series of past years) assuming a common \\(Y\\) and \\(X\\) This \\(L(x)\\) here is the same as the least-square estimate as in 1.1 Proof. Start with\\(y = a + bx\\) and plug in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) from proposition 1.1 We get: \\(\\begin{align} y &amp;= (\\bar{y} - b\\bar{x}) + bx \\\\ &amp;= \\bar{y} + b \\left(x - \\bar{x}\\right) \\\\ &amp;= \\left(x - \\bar{x}\\right) \\dfrac{\\mathrm{Cov}(X,Y)}{\\mathrm{Var}(X)} + \\bar{y} \\\\ \\end{align}\\) Which equals \\(L(x)\\) \\(\\therefore\\) the least-square estimate is the best linear estimate of \\(Q(x)\\) Remark. If not for sampling error, the least square method will give us the best linear approximation to the Bayesian estimate, regardless of the distributions of \\(X\\) or \\(Y\\) 1.3.2 Credibility Form of the Dev’ Formula Alternative way to express \\(L(x)\\), following Bühlmann credibility, we express \\(L(x)\\) in terms of: Expected Value of the Process Variance (\\(EVPV\\)) \\(\\mathrm{E}_Y\\left[\\mathrm{Var}(X \\mid Y )\\right]\\) Variance of the Hypothetical Mean (\\(VHM\\)) \\(\\mathrm{Var}_Y(\\mathrm{E}\\left[X \\mid Y \\right])\\) We can read \\(VHM\\) as distrust in underwriters and EVPV distrust in the claims department Use the method below when the least-square assumption fails (i.e. Year to year changes in loss and loss distributions are small, or can be corrected for) Formula below requires additional hypothesis (in paper appendix?) Proposition 1.6 (Development Formula 2) Suppose that there is a real number \\(d \\neq 0\\) such that \\(\\mathrm{E}\\left[X \\mid Y = y \\right] = dy\\) for all \\(y\\) \\(L(x) = Z \\underbrace{\\dfrac{x}{d}}_{\\begin{array}{c} \\text{Dev&#39;}\\\\ \\text{Method}\\\\ \\end{array}} + (1-Z)\\underbrace{\\mathrm{E[Y]}}_{ELR}\\) Formula is the credibility weighting of the chainladder estimate and ELR estimate If \\(EVPV = 0\\) \\(\\Rightarrow\\) Full weight to the chainladder If \\(VHM = 0\\) \\(\\Rightarrow\\) Full weight to the \\(\\mathrm{E}[Y]\\) Proof. Start with the proposition 1.4 and we set \\(\\dfrac{\\mathrm{Cov}(X,Y)}{\\mathrm{Var}(X)} = \\dfrac{1}{d} \\dfrac{VHM}{VHM + EVPV}\\) \\(\\begin{align} L(x) &amp;= (x - \\mathrm{E[X]})\\dfrac{Cov(X,Y)}{Var(X)} + \\mathrm{E[Y]} \\\\ &amp;= (x - \\mathrm{E[X]}) \\left \\{ \\dfrac{1}{d} \\dfrac{VHM}{VHM + EVPV} \\right \\} + \\mathrm{E[Y]} \\\\ &amp;= (x - \\mathrm{E[X]}) \\left \\{ \\dfrac{1}{d} Z \\right \\} + \\mathrm{E[Y]} \\\\ &amp;= Z \\dfrac{x}{d} - Z \\dfrac{\\mathrm{E}[X]}{d} + \\mathrm{E}[Y] \\\\ &amp;= Z \\dfrac{x}{d} - Z \\mathrm{E}[Y] + \\mathrm{E}[Y] \\\\ &amp;= Z \\dfrac{x}{d} + (1 - Z) \\mathrm{E}[Y] \\\\ \\end{align}\\) Which is what we have above in proposition 1.6 Proposition 1.7 (Method for Z) Calculate Z to use with formula in proposition 1.6 \\(Z = \\dfrac{VHM}{VHM + EVPV} = \\dfrac{\\mathrm{Var_Y(E[X|Y])}}{\\mathrm{Var_Y(E[X|Y])}+\\mathrm{E_Y[Var(X|Y)]}}\\) \\(VHM = d^2 \\sigma^2_Y\\) \\(EVPV = \\sigma^2_d[\\sigma^2_Y + \\mathrm{E[Y]}^2]\\) \\(d =\\) % reported Remark. We use the above \\(Z\\) when underlying distribution not stable (historical not a good predictor) LS only works when the underlying distn are stable We assumes the following \\(d \\: {\\perp\\!\\!\\!\\!\\perp} \\: X\\): reporting speed does not vary with the volume of claims \\(D = \\dfrac{X}{Y}\\) Here we typically assume the \\(\\sigma_{\\frac{X}{Y}}\\) does not depend on \\(Y\\) Results sensitive to \\(\\mathrm{E[Y]}\\) and \\(\\mathrm{E[D]}\\) but not the \\(\\sigma\\) Remark. Alternatively, \\(Z = \\dfrac{b}{c}\\), where \\(c\\) is the CDF and \\(b\\) is from the LS This yield the LS results (Where we assume there’s no change in the underlying year to year data) Assume same \\(d\\) for any size of \\(y\\); Not necessarily true for large or small \\(y\\) Proof. Start with \\(\\dfrac{\\mathrm{Cov}(X,Y)}{\\mathrm{Var}(X)} = \\dfrac{1}{d} \\dfrac{VHM}{VHM + EVPV}\\) Based on 1.7 we have \\(Z = \\dfrac{VHM}{VHM + EVPV}\\) And \\(b\\) from 1.1 \\(\\dfrac{\\mathrm{Cov}(X,Y)}{\\mathrm{Var}(X)}\\) Then we have \\(b = \\dfrac{1}{d} Z\\) Next, \\(\\dfrac{1}{d} = \\dfrac{1}{\\text{% Reported}} = \\text{Reported CDF} = c\\) Finally we have \\(Z = \\dfrac{b}{c}\\) Proposition 1.8 (Poisson-Binomial Special Case) \\(L(x) = x + (1-d)\\mathrm{E(Y)}\\) \\(Z = d\\) Same as BF BF is optimal when claim counts follow Poi - Bin Proof. Start with \\(EVPV\\) and \\(VHM\\) under the Poisson-Binomial case as discussed in proposition 1.2 \\(EVPV = \\mathrm{E}[yd(1-d)] = \\mu d(1-d)\\) \\(VHM = \\mathrm{Var}(yd) = \\mu d^2\\) Then \\(Z = \\dfrac{\\mu d^2}{\\mu d^2 + \\mu d(1-d)} = d\\) And we get what we have from proposition 1.8 \\(L(x) = x + (1-d)\\mathrm{E(Y)}\\) Remark. Note that \\(L(x) = Q(x)\\) (as in proposition 1.2) since \\(Q(x)\\) is linear, so the best linear estimate = the bayesian estimate Proposition 1.9 (Negative Bin-Binomial Special Case) \\(L(x) = \\dfrac{x}{d + p(1-d)} + \\dfrac{\\mu p (1-d)}{d + p(1-d)}\\) \\(Z = \\dfrac{d}{d + p(1-d)}\\) Remark. \\(VHM\\) is larger here than in the Poi-Binomial case while the \\(EVPV\\) is the same \\(\\therefore\\) \\(Z\\) is larger \\(\\Rightarrow\\) Chainladder method gets more weight Also note that since \\(Q(x)\\) is still linear, \\(L(x) = Q(x)\\) 1.3.3 Caseload Effect In proposition 1.6 we assumed the expected number of claims reported is \\(\\propto\\) number of claims incurred Not necessarily true e.g. claim is more likely to be reported in a timely fashion when the caseload (case reserve) is low, and we expect the development ratio \\(\\dfrac{\\mathrm{E}[X \\mid Y = y]}{y}\\) to be not a constant decreasing function of \\(y\\) When \\(D\\) and \\(Y\\) not independent the credibility-based development formula still works (i.e. constant development ratio is not essential for a credibility-based development formula) e.g. \\(d\\) larger for small \\(y\\) since small claims are reported more timely, so settle faster e.g. the opposite situation when large \\(y\\) has as larger \\(d\\): For a property book when large weather event happens, report quicker Proposition 1.10 (Development Formula 3) Supposed there are real numbers \\(d \\neq 0\\) and \\(x_0\\) such that \\(\\mathrm{E}[X \\mid Y= y] = dy + x_0\\) for all \\(y\\) \\(L(x) = Z \\dfrac{x - x_0}{d} + (1-Z)\\mathrm{E[Y]}\\) \\(Z = \\dfrac{VHM}{VHM + EVPV}\\) Remark. Assumptions: \\(\\mathrm{E[X|Y=y]} = dy + x_0\\) \\(x_0\\) is for the fixed salary \\(d \\neq 0\\) Development ratio \\(= d + \\dfrac{x_0}{y}\\) Which does decrease as \\(y\\) gets larger This gives \\(\\mathrm{E}[X \\mid Y = 0] = x_0 &gt; 0\\) Which is okay consider claims department in real life Impossible to determine \\(x_0\\) and \\(d\\) in practice but this shows that the least square methods still make sense when development ratio varies with caseload "],

When we use weighted volume average \\(w_{i,k} = \\dfrac{c_{i,k}}{\\sum \\limits_{j} c_{j,k}}\\) The weights that minimize the variance is inversely proportional to the variance of the item we are estimating We want weights \\(w_{i,k}\\) for each \\(i\\) on \\(\\left( \\dfrac{c_{i,k+1}}{c_{i,k}} \\right)\\) The weight we apply to each \\(\\left( \\dfrac{c_{i,k+1}}{c_{i,k}} \\right)\\) varies based on the variance of \\(\\left( \\dfrac{c_{i,k+1}}{c_{i,k}} \\right)\\) And if \\(\\left( \\dfrac{c_{i,k+1}}{c_{i,k}} \\right)\\) has high variance its weight will be lower to minimize the total variance of our estimate of \\(\\hat{f}_k = \\left( \\dfrac{c_{1,k+1}}{c_{1,k}} \\right) \\times w_{1,k} + \\cdots + \\left( \\dfrac{c_{I,k+1}}{c_{I,k}} \\right) \\times w_{I,k}\\) High variance estimate get lower weight: \\[\\dfrac{1}{w_{i,k}} \\propto \\mathrm{Var}\\left( \\dfrac{c_{i,k+1}}{c_{i,k}} \\right)\\] Since \\(c_{i,k}\\) is known, we can pull it out of the variance term \\[\\dfrac{1}{w_{i,k}} \\propto \\dfrac{\\mathrm{Var}(c_{i,k+1})}{c_{i,k}^2}\\] and we get \\[\\begin{equation} w_{i,k} \\times \\mathrm{Var}(c_{i,k+1}) \\propto c_{i,k}^2 \\tag{4.2} \\end{equation}\\] Recall the weight for the volume weighted average is: \\[\\begin{align} w_{i,k} &amp;= \\dfrac{c_{i,k}}{\\sum \\limits_{j} c_{j,k}}\\\\ w_{i,k} &amp;\\propto c_{i,k}\\\\ \\end{align}\\] Applying the above to equation (4.2) we get: \\[\\begin{align} c_{i,k} \\times \\mathrm{Var}(c_{i,k+1}) &amp;\\propto c_{i,k}^2 \\\\ \\mathrm{Var}(c_{i,k+1}) &amp;\\propto c_{i,k} \\\\ \\mathrm{Var}(c_{i,k+1}) &amp;= \\alpha^2_k \\times c_{i,k} \\\\ \\end{align}\\] And we have chainladder assumption 3 (Prop. 4.3) 4.1.3 LDF Selections Assumptions Recall equation (4.1) and (4.2) Table 4.1: Relationships between weight, variance and residual (Mack) Weight \\(w_{i,k}\\) Description Variance Residual (4.9) 1 Simple Average \\(\\alpha_k^2 \\times \\mathbf{c_{i,k}^2}\\) \\(\\varepsilon_{i,k} = \\dfrac{c_{i,k+1} - c_{i,k} \\: \\hat{f_k}}{\\sqrt{\\mathbf{c_{i,k}^2}}}\\) \\(c_{i,k}\\) Weighted Average \\(\\alpha_k^2 \\times \\mathbf{c_{i,k}}\\) \\(\\varepsilon_{i,k} = \\dfrac{c_{i,k+1} - c_{i,k} \\: \\hat{f_k}}{\\sqrt{\\mathbf{c_{i,k}}}}\\) \\(c_{i,k}^2\\) Least Square2 \\(\\alpha_k^2 \\times \\mathbf{1}\\) \\(\\varepsilon_{i,k} = \\dfrac{c_{i,k+1} - c_{i,k} \\: \\hat{f_k}}{\\sqrt{\\mathbf{1}}}\\) Note the least square here we are forcing the intercept through the origin Assumption for LS is that variance is the same for each exposure year (See Brosius) Use different method for LDF selection based on variance assumption Variance and the weight always multiply to \\(c_{j,k}^2\\) 4.1.4 Violation of Assumptions Correlation between on AYs and another Assumption 2 (Prop. 4.2) is violated Not necessarily assumption 1 (Prop. 4.1) e.g. Strong calendar year effects (i.e. faster payment, changing inflation) will lead to correlation along a diagonal Check using calendar year test A single \\(\\hat{f}_k\\) is not appropriate for all years \\(i\\) Assumption 1 (Prop. 4.1) is violated Dependence among columns Assumption 1 (Prop. 4.1) is violated Not necessarily assumption 2 (Prop. 4.2) If losses in the follow period are inversely correlated to the losses in the current period, then we’ll have correlation between adjacent LDFs but still maintain independence of AYs If residuals are not random around zero Assumption 3 (Prop. 4.3) is violated If we see any trends or change in magnitude Check with residual test 4.1.5 Strength/Weakness of Chainladder Weakness Tail LDFs depend on very few observations High variability in the reported claims in the most recent years lead to uncertainty \\(c_{I,1} = 0\\) \\(\\Rightarrow\\) \\(\\hat{R}_{I,1} = 0\\), which is not reasonable Results need to be judged by someone who knows the business under consideration Unexpected future changes can make the observations obsolete Strength User knows exactly how the method works and it’s weakness Can be easily explained to non-actuaries "],

Since this is a non-linear model, we need an iterative method to minimize to SSE We can use weighted least squares if the variances of the residuals are not constant over the triangle We need to minimize the variance of each residual \\(\\varepsilon(w,d)\\) \\[\\mathrm{Var}(\\varepsilon(w,d)) \\propto f(d)^p h(w)^q\\] Remark. \\(p\\) &amp; \\(q\\) typically \\(\\in [0,1,2]\\) And regression weights (applied to each \\(f(d)\\) or \\(h(w)\\)) will be \\(\\dfrac{1}{f(d)^p h(w)^q}\\) (inversely proportional to variance, similar to Mack 1994) Since \\(\\mathrm{E}[q(w,d)] = f(d)h(w)\\) \\(f(d) = \\dfrac{\\mathrm{E}[q(w,d)]}{h(w)}\\), and \\(h(w) = \\dfrac{\\mathrm{E}[q(w,d)]}{f(d)}\\) So the actual \\(\\dfrac{q(w,d)}{h(w)}\\) is an estimate of \\(f(d)\\) and vice versa And we can estimate \\(f(d)\\) based on a weighted average of each observation Different variance assumption for \\(\\varepsilon\\) \\(\\Rightarrow\\) different parameters (weight) similar to the Chainladder method in table 5.2 Table 5.4: Variance and parameters for various form of \\(\\mathrm{E}[q(w,d) \\mid \\text{Data to }w+d] = f(d)h(w)\\) Method \\(\\mathrm{Var}(\\varepsilon(w,d)) \\propto f(d)^p h(w)^q\\) \\(\\mathbf{f(d)}\\): Col Parameters \\(\\mathbf{h(w)}\\): Row Parameters BF1 \\(p=q=0\\) \\(f(d) = \\dfrac{\\sum_w h^2 \\frac{q}{h}}{\\sum_w h^2}\\) \\(h(w) = \\dfrac{\\sum_d f^2 \\frac{q}{f}}{\\sum_d f^2}\\) Cape Cod2 \\(p=q=0\\) \\(f(d) = \\dfrac{\\sum_w h^2 \\frac{q}{h}}{\\sum_w h^2}\\) \\(h = \\dfrac{\\sum_\\Delta f^2 \\frac{q}{f}}{\\sum_\\Delta f^2}\\) BF (Var \\(\\propto\\) \\(fh\\)) \\(p=q=1\\) \\(f^2(d) = \\dfrac{\\sum_w h \\left( \\frac{q}{h} \\right) ^2}{\\sum_w h}\\) \\(h^2(w) = \\dfrac{\\sum_d f \\left( \\frac{q}{f} \\right)^2}{\\sum_d f}\\) BF: assumes each \\(q(w,d)\\) have constant variance (least square, standard regression) For \\(h(w)\\) weight is \\(f(d)^2\\) and cells with higher expectes loss get higher weight For \\(f(d)\\) weight is expected ultimate losses squared, years with higher expected losses get higher weight Cape Cod: also assumes constant variance Recall from Mack 1994, we need to look at the residual graphs to determine which variance assumption is appropriate 5.2.3.3 Iteration Process Work in progress section Need to seed one of them and iterate until convergence \\(f(d)\\) \\(\\sum \\downarrow\\); \\(h(w)\\) \\(\\sum \\rightarrow\\) (for the constant var BF) Use the above to estimate the parameters and then calculate the unpaid When combining parameters, don’t count the \\(f(0)\\) and always subtract 1 Step 1) Start iteration with the \\(f(d)\\) from Chainladder For age greater than 0, these are the incremental ATA factors \\(\\div\\) ATU factors For age 0, subtract the sum of the other factors from unity Step 2) Find \\(h(w)\\)’s that minimize the SSE One regression for each \\(w\\) Step 3) Find \\(f(d)\\)’s that minimize the SSE based on the \\(h(w)\\) above Step 4) Do this till convergence 5.2.3.4 Counting n and p for SSE For n For reserving: number of cell in the triangle minus the first column \\(\\dfrac{m(m-1)}{2}\\) Since we don’t need to forecast the first column to calculate the unpaid For pricing: number of cell in the triangle For p (Just a walk through of how we get the \\(m\\) in Table @ref(#tab:venter-alt-pattern)) BF: Start with \\(2m\\) parameters all the \\(f(d)\\)’s and \\(h(w)\\)’s We don’t need \\(f(0)\\) for reserves again since we don’t need to forcast the first column Less one more due to degree of freedom (?) Since you can fix any one of the parameters and still get the same results So we have \\(p = 2m-2\\) Similarly for Cape Cod but we only start with \\(m + 1\\) so we ended up with \\(m-1\\) taking out the \\(f(d)\\) and the degree of freedom Grouped BF is similar as well if you don’t group the \\(f(0)\\) If you group the \\(f(0)\\) you can’t subtract one for that as you’ll be using the parameter Chainladder you have \\(m\\) for all the \\(f(d)\\)’s to start with and less the \\(f(d)\\) 5.2.4 Implication 3: Linearity The forecast incremental losses might not be a linear function (e.g. \\(q(w,d) = a\\sqrt{c(w,d)}\\)) Look at residuals as function of previous Test for linearity by making sure the residuals are not a sequence of positive then negative and vice versa Do this for each regression (i.e. every \\(d\\)) 5.2.5 Implication 4: Stability Look at empirical LDFs \\(f(d)\\) down a column Use the entire history if factors are stable Take more recent average if unstable or follow a trend Can compare rolling 5 year averages as well 5.2.6 Implication 5: No Correlation on Columns (Test for independence) Calculate Pearson correlation for every pair of columns with at least 3 LDFs This is a test on the LDFs Test with only 2 LDFs will either be 1 or -1 Not just adjacent LDF pairs like in Mack-1994 \\(\\therefore\\) For a \\(m \\times m\\) triangle we have \\({7 \\choose 2}\\) pairs (7 because only 9 columns of LDFs and we take out the 2 columns with less than 3 LDFs) Correlation: \\[r = \\dfrac{\\sum \\tilde{x} \\tilde{y}}{\\sqrt{\\sum \\tilde{x}^2\\sum \\tilde{y}^2}}\\] Where \\(\\tilde{x} = x - \\bar{x}\\) and \\(\\tilde{y} = y - \\bar{y}\\) \\(x\\)’s and \\(y\\)’s are incremental LDFs - 1 But actually not necessary since -1 doesn’t affect the correlation Test statistics for significance is \\(T \\sim t_{n-2}\\) \\[T = r \\sqrt{ \\dfrac{n-2}{1-r^2} }\\] Look up the t-value from table for 90% If \\(|T| &lt;\\) table value \\(\\Rightarrow\\) Not correlated Perform test for all columns We deem the triangle have significant correlations if more than \\(0.1 x + \\sqrt{x}\\) pairs are correlated x = # of pair tested = \\({m - 3 \\choose 2}\\) for a \\(m \\times m\\) triangle 5.2.7 Implication 6: No High of Low Diagonals (Test for independence) Similar to Mack’s CY Test Key Idea: Run regression on the triangle with a dummy variable for each diagonal Each \\(q(w,d)\\) is regressed against the prior cumulative losses + dummy variable for which diagonal it is in \\(q(w,d) \\sim c(w,d-1) + dummy_{CY}\\) If losses are significantly higher or lower in a diagonal \\(\\Rightarrow\\) The coefficient of the dummy variable would be statistically significant (i.e. coefficient is double the \\(\\sigma\\)) Only includes diagonals that forcast at least 2 elements Caveat: Diagonal effect is additive More likely to see multiplicative impact. e.g. from inflation This can be implement with a regression on the logarithm of the losses 5.2.7.1 Diagonal Trend as Inflation Consider CY trend as inflation and model \\(q(w,d)\\) with a diagonal parameter \\(g(w+d)\\), where \\(w+d\\) is the diagonal \\[\\mathrm{E}[q(w,d)] = f(d)h(w)g(w+d)\\] This will have parameters for each row, column, and diagonal Can be reduce similar to the grouped BF We can model a constant CY trend to reduce the parameters e.g. \\(g(w+d) = (1+j)^{w+d}\\) "],

Doesn’t work when the column sum to a negative value Method 2: Subtract a negative constant \\(\\Psi\\) \\[\\begin{equation} q^+(w,d) = q(w,d) - \\Psi \\\\ \\ln[q^+(w,d)] \\text{ for all } Cell_{w,d} \\tag{9.16} \\end{equation}\\] Pick \\(\\Psi =\\) largest negative value in the column Apply (9.16) before solving the GLM system of equations (e.g. (9.2) and (9.4)) Then adjust the fitted values by adding back \\(\\Phi\\) to reduce each fitted incremental value \\[\\begin{equation} m_{w,d} = m^+_{w,d} + \\Psi \\tag{9.17} \\end{equation}\\] Can use this method combined with method 1 to take care of the extra large negative ones Need to make use the absolute value for the residual and re-sampling formula, modify (9.8) and (9.14) with below: \\[\\begin{equation} r_{wd} = \\dfrac{q(w,d)-m_{wd}}{\\sqrt{abs\\{m^z_{wd}\\}}} \\tag{9.18} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} q^*(w,d) = m_{wd} + r^*_p \\sqrt{abs\\{m^z_{wd}\\}} \\tag{9.19} \\end{equation}\\] Method 3: Use simplified GLM Use ODP bootstrap (i.e. Chainladder with volume weighted average LDFs) This will yield different estimate than using the GLM framework with adjustment 1 or 2 9.8.1.2 Simulating Negative Values From above, we might have the fitted \\(m_{wd}\\) that are negative, which will be an issue when used in Step 4 of the bootstrap simulation, when we need to model the process variance with \\(Gamma(m_{wd},\\phi m_{wd})\\) Since \\(Gamma\\) only takes positive parameters Adjustment to the Gamma Distribution with negative \\(m_{wd}\\) \\[\\begin{equation} Gamma(abs\\{m_{wd}\\}, \\phi abs\\{m_{wd}\\}) + 2m_{wd} \\tag{9.20} \\end{equation}\\] This will maintain the right skew of Gamma while having the mean of \\(m_{wd}\\) Alternatively if we use \\(-Gamma(abs\\{m_{wd}\\}, \\phi abs\\{m_{wd}\\})\\) it’ll flip the curve to skew left 9.8.1.3 Extreme Outcomes from Negative Values Column with negative mean in the early ages can results in vary large LDFs (and lead to simulated outcomes that are 1,000 times greater than our mean) Negative mean causes one column of cumulative values to sum close to 0 and the next to sum to a much larger number resulting in extremely large LDF and there for projection that are extremely large Need to address this as it’ll throw off the mean even if you don’t care about the high percentiles 3 options to address this: Remove the extreme iterations Beware of understating the the likelihood of extreme outcomes Recalibrate the Model First need to identify the source of the negative losses Review data used and parameter selection e.g. remove the AYs that might not represent current behavior e.g. if due to S&amp;S then you can just model them separately and then correlate them during simulation Limit Incremental Losses to 0 Either with the simulated mean (Step 2) or the process var step (Step 4) Replace with negatives with 0s Can just do it in certain columns 9.8.2 Non-Zero Sum of Residuals Residuals are supposed to be iid with mean zero and constant variance \\(\\therefore\\) Sum of our residuals from the triangle should be 0 Not necessarily the case since this is just a sample Consequence: Simulated outcomes will be higher than the mean if sum of residuals are positive (and vice versa) 2 options to address this: Keep it if we believe this to be characteristics of the data set Add a constant to each non-zero residual so that it sums to 0 Then sample from the adjusted residuals If residuals are significantly different from zero then the fit of the model should be questioned 9.8.3 Using L-year Weighted Average Select LDFs based on the latest \\(L\\) years GLM Bootstrap Only use \\(L+1\\) diagonals of data to get \\(L\\) diagonals of LDFs Excluded diagonals are given zero weight and we’ll have less CY trend parameter (if we’re using it) In the simulation we’ll only sample residuals for the trapezoid used to parameterize the model (since that’s all we’ll need to estimate parameters) Simplified GLM Get L-year weighted average LDFs Will only have residuals (to sample from) for the most recent L + 1 diagonals In the simulation we’ll create the entire resampled triangle (Since we need the cumulative losses for each row) For projection using the resampled triangle we’ll still only use the L-year average LDFs The 2 methods will results in different results GLM Bootstrap: Models the incremental losses in the trapezoid Simplified GLM: Models the same losses but in relation to the cumulative losses, which include the non-modeled losses in the diagonals excluded 9.8.4 Missing Value ODP Bootstrap: Missing data impact: LDFs Fitted triangle (if missing value lies on the most recent diagonal) Residuals Degree of freedom Solutions: Impute from surrounding values Modify LDFs to exclude missing value Similar to the L-year weighted average: Missing value will be resampled so the cumulative losses can be calculated Projection from the resampled triangle will exclude the missing cell for resampled LDF selection GLM Bootstrap Impact on the is limited, we’ll just have less observations 9.8.5 Outliers Remove outliers if they are not representative of the variability of the losses, below are the options: Remove the entire row (easy if it’s the 1st row of the triangle) Remove the values and treat them as missing values Not use the residual but do create a sampled value in that cell Significant number of outliers might indicate bad model fit GLM Bootstrap Pick new parameters (grouping parameters) Change the error term distribution from \\(z=1\\) ODP Bootstrap Use L-year weighted average Heteroscedasticity may exist See adjustment next sub section and diagnostics Since we dont’ make a distribution assumption, the number of outliers could mean the data is quite skewed and it’s appropriate that is showing up in the simulation 9.8.6 Heteroskedasticity Issue of non constant variance ODP bootstrap assumes residuals are \\(iid\\) with constant variance No longer possible to sample the residuals from the whole triangle with heteroskedasticity GLM Bootstrap has the additional flexibility of choosing parameters to alleviate heteroscedasticity For ODP Bootstrap: 3 ways to deal with heteroscedasticity below They also work for GLM Bootstrap 9.8.6.1 Stratified Sampling Stratified Sampling Split the triangle into groups with similar variance Only sample residuals from the same group Cons Each group may not be that large, which limits the amount of variability in the possible outcomes 9.8.6.2 Hetero-Adjustment to the Residuals Calculate a hetero-adjustment factor to scale the residuals to the same level: Group the residuals with similar then calculate the \\(\\sigma\\) of the residuals in each group \\(i\\) Hetero-adjustment factor: \\(h^i\\) i.e. The largest \\(\\sigma\\) \\(\\div\\) each group’s \\(\\sigma\\) \\[\\begin{equation} h_i = \\dfrac{\\sigma \\left( \\bigcup_1^j r^H_{wd} \\right)}{\\sigma \\left( \\bigcup_i r^H_{wd} \\right)} \\:\\: : \\:\\: \\text{for each } 1 \\leq i \\leq j \\tag{9.21} \\end{equation}\\] Scale up the residuals: Residual (9.8) \\(\\times\\) Hat Matrix Factor (9.10) \\(\\times\\) Hetero Factor (9.21) \\[\\begin{equation} r_{wd}^{iH} = r_{wd} \\times f_{wd}^H \\times h^i \\tag{9.22} \\end{equation}\\] Need to divide the sampled residual by \\(h^i\\) to reflect the variability of group \\(i\\) \\[\\begin{equation} q^{i*}(w,d) = m_{wd} + \\dfrac{r^{i*}}{h^i}\\sqrt{m_{wd}} \\tag{9.23} \\end{equation}\\] Adjust the variance for the process variance step in the simulation \\[\\begin{equation} Gamma(m_{wd}, \\dfrac{\\phi m_{wd}}{h^i}) \\tag{9.24} \\end{equation}\\] Remark. The hetero adjustment factors are new parameters and will impact degrees of freedom and will impact the scale parameter (9.13) and the degrees of freedom adjustment factor (9.9) 9.8.6.3 Non-constant Scale Parameters Adjust the dispersion factor \\(\\phi\\) as well as the residuals (similar to above) Calculate the hetero adjustment factor \\(h_i\\) using formula (9.26) below: \\[\\begin{equation} h_i = \\sqrt{\\dfrac{\\phi}{\\phi_i}} \\tag{9.25} \\end{equation}\\] Perform step 3 and 4 from the second method above (i.e. Equation (9.22) and (9.23)) Calculate \\(\\phi_i\\) for each homogenious residual group \\(i\\) (\\(n_i\\) = number of residuals in group): \\[\\begin{equation} \\phi_i = \\dfrac{N}{N-p}\\dfrac{\\sum_{w,d \\in \\{i\\}}r^2_{w,d}}{n_i} \\tag{9.26} \\end{equation}\\] Use \\(\\phi_i\\) for the process variance step Remark. The \\(\\phi_i\\) here also amount to new parameters that will impact the degrees of freedom adjustment factor (9.9) The hetero adjustment factor (9.25) is more theoretically sound but in practice very similar to (9.21) 9.8.7 Heteroecthesious Data ODP bootstrap requirements: Symmetrical shape (annual by annual, quarter by quarterly, etc triangles) Homoecthesious data (similar exposure) Heteroecthesious = Accident years have different level of exposures Here we are focusing on heteroecthesious due to interim evaluation dates: Partial first development period Partial latest calendar period 9.8.7.1 Partial First Development Period This means the entire first development period is shorter than the rest e.g. Annual data evaluated as of 6/30 with 1/1-12/31 AYs We’ll have a triangle with development periods @6, 18, 30, 42, etc Pearson residuals use the square root of the fitted value to make them all exposure independent (debatable…) \\(\\therefore\\) No impact to residuals Adjustment: Scale down the most recent AY projection to the appropriate exposure period (e.g. half the exposure based on example above), we have 2 options: Prorate the mean of the incremental cells for the latest AY between step 3 and 4 of the bootstrap process and then proceed to Step 4 for the process variance as usual Prorate the simulated incremental cells for the latest AY after the process variance step (Step 4) 9.8.7.2 Partial Latest Calendar Period This is where the latest diagonal is partial diagonal e.g. Evaluate in between typical data evaluation date Evaluation @6/30 for a 1/1-12/31 AYs and 12-24-36 triangle Similar problem as partial first development period + partial data in most recent diagonal ODP Bootstrap Select LDF by excluding latest diagonal or prorating the latest diagonal to full year Adjusted simulation process Calculate sampled triangle as usual (diagonal will be of full year) Calculate full year LDFs and Ultimate as usual Additional steps: De-annualize the diagonal Interpolate the full year LDFs to match the diagonal Forecast loss Scale down the latest AY similar to the partial AY adjustment No change GLM Bootstrap Should be something similar 9.8.8 Exposure Adjustment Adjustment for when exposure changed dramatically over the years (e.g. rapid growth or run off) ODP Bootstrap Divide losses by exposure (model loss cost) Need to multiply the simulated results by the exposure (after the process variance step) GLM Bootstrap Adjust losses by exposure similar to above Fit to the exposure adjusted losses should be exposure weighted (i.e. exposure adjusted losses with higher exposure are assumed to have lower variance, see Anderson et al. (2007)) This will need fewer AY parameters since the exposure adjustment should capture a lot of the difference between AYs 9.8.9 Parametric Bootstrapping *ODP Bootstrap See CAS Tail Factor Working Party Report (2013) Add tail factor to the algorithm by assuming the factor follows a distribution (other considerations such as process variance, hetero-adj can all be extended to include the tail factors) Should be an extrapolation of the incremental tail factors (instead of a single tail factor to ultimate) Tail factors typically have \\(\\sigma &lt;\\) 50% of the tail factor - 1 (But should compare to the \\(\\sigma\\) of the AtA factors leading up to the tail in both the actual and simulated data) GLM Bootstrap Continue to use the last \\(\\beta_d\\) to estimate the tail by continuing to apply it (similarly for CY parameter) 9.8.10 Fitting a Distribution to ODP Bootstrap Residuals Data points from triangle may not be representative of the underlying distribution Whether the most extreme observation is a 1-in-100, 1-in-1000 event Alternative is to fit a distribution to the residuals and sample from the distribution instead i.e. parametric bootstrapping "],

R\\) then set \\(y_t = y^*\\), else \\(y_t = y_{t-1}\\) Remark. \\(R_1\\) represents the ratio of the posterior probability of the proposal \\(y^*\\) to the posterior probability of \\(y_{t-1}\\) The higher the value of \\(R_1\\), the more likely will be accepted into the chain Regardless of how the proposal density distribution is chosen, the distribution of \\(y_t\\) can be regarded as a sample from the posterior distribution, after a suitable burn-in period Example We can look at trace plots to look at the value of the parameter as the chain progresses More on how it might break in the paper… The key is to be able to scale the proposal distribution to minimize auto correlation This is difficult with many parameters Minimizing autocorrelation in Metropolis-Hasting A good statistics to look at is the acceptance rate of \\(y^*\\) 50% is near optimal for a one parameter model and the rate decreases to about 25% as we increase the number of parameters in the model There are methods to automatically adjust the proposal density function in Metropolis-Hastins All these have been mechanized in software like JAGS and STAN The phase of generating the Markov chain where the proposal density function is optimized is called the “adaptive” state (as discussed above) As models become more complex, adaptive MCMC may not be good enough to eliminate the auto correlation Theory on Markov chain convergence will still hold but there is no guarantee on how fast it will converge If there is significance auto correlation after the best scaling effort, the next best practice is to increase \\(t_3\\) until there are sufficient number of ups and downs in the trace plot and then take a sample of the \\((t_1 + t_2 +1)\\)th to \\((t_1 + t_2 + t_3)\\)th iterations This process is known as “thinning” 11.11.3 Usecase Example for Actuaries Look at how the posterior distribution of \\(\\mu\\) might be of interest Consider a fitted lognormal distribution for a set of claims to determine the cost of an XS layer Given \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma\\) of the lognormal we can determine the cost of an XS layer (see Klugman, Panjer, and Willmot and the actuar package) As the posterior distribution of \\(\\mu\\) reflects the parameter risk in the model, it is also possible to reflect the parameter risk in the expected cost of a layer by calculating the expected cost of the layer for each \\(\\mu\\) in the simulated posterior distribution It is possible to simulate an actual outcome of a loss \\(X\\) in a layer given \\(\\mu\\) in the posterior distribution The distribution \\(X\\) calculated this way reflects both the parameter risk and process risk in the model 11.11.4 Bayesian interence Using Gibbs Sampling (BUGS) WinBUGS, JAGS are examples of software using Gibbs sampling Sample work process: Read data into R and call JAGS script with R package “runjags” Fetch the sample of the posterior back into R to calculate statistics of interest JAGS perform the Metropolis-Hasting algorithm we described above It also has a number of convergence diagnostics "],

Admitted portion of the premium asset appears on the balance sheet as the “Asset for Accrued Retrospective Premiums” Background: Retrospective policies were popular in 1996: For insured: Returns premium to insured for good experience Cashflow: Premiums are due with short lag to losses, as opposed to upfront For insurer: Allows insurer to attracts good customers that expect to see favorable loss experience through loss control and loss management Allows an insurance company to shift a significant portion of the risk to the insured (Uncertainty due to inflation, rate regulations, uncertainty in claims compensation, increase utilization of the insurance benefits, growing attorney involvement) Estimating the premium asset was needed for many commercial lines insurers as this asset frequency exceeds 10% of surplus 14.1.1 Discussion of Berry and Fitzgibbon Method Method for calculating retro reserve [Premium deviation to date] - [Ultimate premium deviation] Definition 14.2 \\[\\dfrac{\\text{Ultimate Premium}}{\\text{Standard Premium}}\\] Ultimate Premiums Deviation: Amount by which the ultimate premium for a retro rated policy is expected to differ from the standard premium (manual premium w/ adj for experience) Premium deviation to date: Amount by which the currently booked premium differs from the standard premium Fitzgibbon Method: Analyze the historical relationship between the loss ratio and the premium deviation using statistical techniques Apply the relationship to the projected loss ratio to calculate the projected ultimate premium deviation Retro reserve = [Ultimate premium deviation] - [Premium deviation to date] Berry Method: Estimate ultimate premium with historical premium emergence pattern Subtract estimated ultimate premium by current premium Caveat: Lack intuitive appeal Methods do not consider how a retro rating formula actually works i.e. premium is a function of loss, with retro rating parameters such as the loss conversion factor, tax multiplier, retro min/max \\(\\therefore\\) Premium asset should be establish as a function of reported loss and the reserve for loss development Where the function is defined by the retro rating parameters "],

cautious (aggressive) choices Things that affect the suitability and usefulness of the model Data quality Choices on assumptions and mathematical method Variety of different risk elements and how they are represented Key elements that differentiate model quality: Model: Reflects relative importance of various risks to business decisions Includes mathematical techniques to reflect dependencies Modelers: Have a deep knowledge of the fundamentals of those risks Have a trusted relationship with senior management Model should take into account the uncertainty from other models (e.g. CAT, ESG, credit risk) that are used as inputs Risks less amenable to detailed representation in enterprise risk model (Non-quantifiable risk): e.g. Op risk (IT exposures, pension inadequacy, key man risk, rogue traers, frade) They are extremely important to the success of a business Requires specialized management process and difficult to incorporate into an overall risk model Can be modeled in bulk using informed judgments (but with high degree of uncertainty) Use model to manage the risk for which the modeling process is effective While some risks are at best weakly represented in such a model and requires other management methods 16.3.2 Key Elements of ERM Underwriting Risk Reserving Risk Asset Risk Dependencies (Correlation) 16.3.2.1 Underwriting Risk Loss Frequency and Severity Distribution Use statistical methods to: Estimate parameters Test quality of fit Understand uncertainties that remain Common distributions for insurance loss are available in many papers Transformed Beta and Gamma Distributions and Aggregate Losses - Venter Continuous Distributions - Kreps Pricing Risk Instability from variations in the premiums as well as losses Misestimation of projected losses as well as competitive market pressures Deficiency may exist for many years for long tailed lines \\(\\Rightarrow\\) Accumulation of reserve deficiency Model should include u/w cycle as it contributes significantly to pricing risk See additional details in ERA 5.2 Parameter Risk: Misestimated parameters, imperfect form and risk not modeled (Likely largest risk net of reinsurance (larger than cat exposure)) Estimation Risk: Error in estimations the form and parameters Depends on available data (i.e. more and better data reduces this risk) Projection Risk: Error on forecast of future value even if we fit the historical data accurately Examples: Freq/Sev trend from the time of the data to the current and future underwriting periods Development of ultimate losses Affected by macro factors (e.g. inflation) and the corresponding dependencies should be reflected in the model Unexpected change in external risk conditions also add to projection risk, e.g. Lower fuel price \\(\\Rightarrow\\) Increased driving Long term shift to more extreme weather Event Risk: Causal link between a large unpredictable event and losses to an insurer Example: Court ruling that favors a large group of policyholders (e.g. class action) Exposure that existed, unknown, for many years comes to light (e.g. asbestos) New cause of loss emerges that was previously regarded as not covered (e.g. environmental, CD) Regulator or court expands coverage by barring important exclusions New entrant into market reduces rates to grab market share Systematic Risk: Operates simultaneously on a large number of policies Undiversifiable, i.e. do not improve with added volume e.g. macro factors such as inflation See additional detail in ERA 3.2 Catastrophe Modeling Uncertainty Exposure to natural and man-made cat Likely largest risk after parameter risk, special case of parameter risk Based on proprietary cat models, further source of uncertainty Differences between commercial models and different versions of the same model Considerable amount of uncertainty in the probabilities of various events and the amount of insured damage Additional uncertainty from data quality Mismatches of company data fields and cat model assumptions Can quantified by the use of more than one model for each peril Cat distributions are subject to the same considerations of parameter risk and correlation as other risk distributions 16.3.2.2 Reserving Risk Adverse development can be significant for long tailed lines \\(\\uparrow\\) reserve uncertainty \\(\\Rightarrow\\) \\(\\uparrow\\) capital requirement &amp; \\(\\uparrow\\) time holding the capital Model needs to capture both process variance and parameter risk Key aspects of risk modeling process Specifying the reserve runoff model Testing it with quality of fit measures Unearned premium reserve should be modeled in underwriting risk 16.3.2.3 Asset Risk Need to focus on issues of the specific markets that the company operates Main asset classes: equities, fixed income, real estate Different types of fixed income are important in different regions FX and inflation are closely related to asset modeling as well Asset Modeling: Probabilistic Reality Modeling scenarios consistent with historical patterns Generate a large variety of scenarios against which to test the insurer’s strategy Scenarios are weighted by probability Scenarios should be reasonable when compared to historical patterns Asset liability matching Offset between insurance risk and investment risk P&amp;C companies can opt for longer duration assets and not match the liabilities to increase investment return while still maintain reasonable ALM risk Need to consider that P&amp;C liabilities are inflation sensitive as well Or if liabilities are carried at PV marked to current interest rate Efficient Frontier: \\(\\sigma\\) vs \\(\\operatorname{E}[Return]\\) See how it changes by modifying reinsurance structure or asset mix More details in ERA 2.4 Modeling Considerations Bonds: Model with arbitrage free models Should capture historical features of bond markets (high auto-correlations and distribution of yield spreads) Equities: Incorporate correlations with bonds Geometric Brownian motion model with additional volatility is more realistic (Allow for more extreme motion or even discontinuities) FX: First model interest rates of the currencies then model the FX rates Changes in actual and anticipated interest rates in two countries lead to changes in the FX rates Interest rate movements across different economies are correlated as well 16.3.2.4 Dependencies Important to capture dependencies or else the model will be unrealistically stable Sources of Dependencies: Simultaneous impact of macro economic conditions on many risks A good ESG should capture the dependence between inflation, interest rates, equity values, etc This will impact asset values Inflation will impact underwriting losses, loss reserve development Interest rates may influence the underwriting cycle U/w cycle, loss trends and reserve development can be correlated across LoB and with each other Cat and other event losses can cross lines Large man made cat (e.g. 9/11) can have impact on both insurance and market risk Difficult to quantify May reference studies of multiple insurers, public insurance industry information and macroeconomic data Still require professional judgement Modeling Dependencies: Avoid using just the correlation coefficient to describe and oversimplify dependency We are most interested in the tail dependency e.g. High inflation or large cat that impacts multiple LoB that would typically be uncorrelated Use copulas to capture different forms of dependency See ERA 3.3 for more details 16.3.3 Setting Capital Requirements ERM help insurer fin the optimum level of capital that balances efficiency and prudence Policyholders (acting through regulators and rating agencies) demand adequate capital Shareholders require that capital be used efficiently Set capital to maximize insurer’s value creates a conceptual framework that unifies the competing requirements of prudence and efficiency See ERA 2.2 for more detail Approaches to setting capital requirements: 1. Default Avoidance: Focused on the tail and protecting policyholders Caveat: S/h will be hurt at much lower loss amount We have the least confidence in the tail of the model \\(\\hookrightarrow\\) More feasible and relevant to focus on thresholds less extreme than default 2. Other Thresholds (Lower than probability of ruin): Probability of downgrade Significant loss \\(\\leadsto\\) \\(\\downarrow\\) financial rating \\(\\leadsto\\) \\(\\downarrow\\) franchise value &gt; loss itself Franchise value: customer base, agency relationships, reputation, infrastructure and expertise Sufficient capital to service renewals Survive and thrive after major cat 16.3.3.1 Convert Probability to Loss Associate the selected probability level with amount of financial loss Smallest amount of loss, \\(\\alpha \\%\\) of the time \\(\\Rightarrow\\) \\(VaR_{100 - \\alpha \\%}\\) Average loss, \\(\\alpha \\%\\) of the time \\(\\Rightarrow\\) \\(TVaR_{100 - \\alpha \\%}\\) 1-in-\\(x\\) years event loss no more than \\(y \\%\\) of capital \\(\\Rightarrow\\) \\(\\dfrac{100}{y} \\times TVaR_{1 - \\frac{1}{x}}\\) Important: Risk measures do not tell us how much capital to hold; They tell us for a given level of capital, what the risk to the company is Determination of optimal capital level is not purely a risk measurement exercise Need to balance sufficient financial strength to attract business and the need of shareholders to achieve attractive return Risk measurement quantifies the risk the company is exposed to in relationship to the capital so established Strategic risk decisions can then be made in the framework created Capital is not set by risk measures, but analyzed by them to understand the sources of risk and for further strategic decision making 16.3.3.2 Risk Adjusted Performance Allocate capital to business units \\(\\Rightarrow\\) Calculate the rate of return \\(\\dfrac{\\text{Profit}}{\\text{Capital}}\\) for that unit \\(\\Rightarrow\\) Compare RoR across BUs Can also allocate risk capital to investments \\(\\Rightarrow\\) Compare riskiness of investments and u/w Validity of such a comparison will depend on the consistency of the risk measures that are developed See ERA 2.2 for more detail "],

Many other risk measures have the advantages above (not just “economic capital” under VaR) Insurers typically use multiple risk measure to see if a consistent picture emerges VaR is typically calculated from the distribution of all risks and then allocate down to inidividual units This provides consistent measurement of risk across units Target Probability Level Current modeling approaches are not able to accurately estimate losses deep in the tail like 1-in-3000 (99.97%) event Bond ratings are discusses at this level but the ratings are not tied to the probabilities Ratings are defined by factors (e.g. interest coverage) Probabilities are published retrospectively after observing rated bonds for many organizations for many years Target probability level is artificial (no theoretical support) Sometimes it is just backed out based on the modeled distribution Suggestion: Should just express actual capital under various risk measures The company sometimes compare held capital to the loss distn stating that it’s holding capital to cover a 1-in-x year event.

Conceptually we want price e.g. Price to coer a standard risk But impossible to define in insurance Use loss ratio or combined ratio etc as a proxy Maybe with adjustments for TVM (e.g. include investment income) Predictor Variable: Information available to calculate the current period criterion and also forecast the forward period criterion Historical criterion variable and it’s components: (e.g. loss, expense) Internal financial variables: (e.g. reserve, capital, capital flow, reinsurance cessions) Regulatory rating variables: (e.g. downgrades and upgrades) Reinsurance sector financials: (e.g. capital held by reinsurers) Econometric variable: (e.g. inflation, unemployment, GDP) Financial market variables: (e.g. interest rates, stock market returns) Competitor Intelligence: Gather information on customers at renewal time and competitors (e.g. Firm’s own agents, customere surveys at renewal, trade publications/news, rate filing) Provides more detailed information on the state of the u/w cycle Need to beware of antitrust and legal issues (e.g. industrial spying) Goal is to look for leading indicatiors that foretell the turn in the cycle 26.3.1 Soft Approach Starts with intense focus on data gathering and intelligence Goal: Give analysts insight into the complex u/w cycle Collect as much information as we can This is a human approach, focused on three methods: Scenarios Detailed written statement describing a possible future state of the world Help company think about how it might respond to different future states Goal is to have a detailed description of the environment and analyzed by minds Delphi Method Gather expert opinion without biasing the group to the opinion of the most senior persons Process: Give background to participants Gather opinions using questionnaire Results are summarized and distributed Allow participants to reconsider and articulate reason for disagreeing Repeat until consensus is reached Formal Competitor Analysis First determine current state, motives, and likely behavior for the main competitors Need database of competitor information that has key financials, new items, and behavioral metrics Overtime, distinction between normal and abnormal statistics becomes evident Key to predicting turns in the u/w cycle is unusually profitable or distressed financial conditions reproduced over a large number of firms 26.3.2 Technical Approach Focus here is on a small number of industry financial statistics (possibly only 1) We have at best only a rudimentary theory underlying the model Autoregressive Model Research shown cycle can be modeled with \\(AR(2)\\) or \\(AR(3)\\) model For \\(AR(2)\\): \\[X_t = b_o + b_1 X_{t-1} + b_2 X_{t-2} + \\sigma \\epsilon_t\\] Use autoregressive model to model P&amp;C industry combined ratios Results showed weak mean regression with lag 1 but strong mean regression at lag 2 Model can be used to forecast a few periods into the future and estimate the distribution for those forecasts VARMAX Generalized multivariate time series that can handle multiple simultaneous variable and utilize external variables General Factor Model Looks like \\(AR(1)\\) but with non-normal mean and a moving temporary mean (determined by \\(z_{t-1}\\)) \\[X_t = c + d(Z_{t-1} - X_{t-1}) + \\tau \\delta_t\\] \\(Z_t = a + b \\cdot Z_{t-1} + \\sigma \\epsilon_t\\) \\(Z_t\\) maybe an unknown or unobservable variable Neither error term needs to be normal Complicated to fit this model Generalized method of moments or efficient method of moments 26.3.3 Behavioral Modeling Econometric Modeling Sit between soft and technical model’s concern for structural insight (soft) and statistical validity (technical) Can be done at an industry level or company level Industry level can be more detailed Company level requires maintaining many individual models and their interactions Can lead to insight from emergent properties (See ERA 4.2) "],

Event risk is higher for property; Liability for HO can also be significant 3 components of internal systemic risk: Specification Error: From not perfectly modeling the insurance process because it’s too complicated or just don’t have the data Parameter Selection Error: Trend is particularly difficult to measure Data Error: Lack of data, lack of knowledge of the underlying pricing, u/w, and claim management process, inadequate knowledge of portfolio Risk categories for external Economic and Social Risks: Inflation, social trends Legislative, Political Risks, Claims Inflation Risks: Change in law, frequency of settlement vs suits to completion, loss trend (Long tail lines) Claim Management Process Change Risk: Change in process of managing claims e.g. case reserve practice Expense Risk: Cost of managing a run-off book Event Risk: natural or man-made CAT (Premium liabilities for property) Latent Claim Risk: Claim from source not currently considered to be covered Recovery Risk: Recoveries from reinsurers or non-reinsurers "]
