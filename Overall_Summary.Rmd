## Section A

### A1 Least Square

Loss Development Using Credibility - Brosius

Least square methods

* Need to know how to calculate $b$

Theoretical Bayesian method and also estimating the Bayesian credibility with 2 methods for getting $Z$

* Can do $Z = \dfrac{b}{c}$ or the VHM EVPV formula
* Under certain relationships between $X$ and $Y$ supports different methods
* Some formulas to remember if we do the theoretical Bayes

Discussion on the caseload effect where the development and ultimate is not independent

### A2 Benktander

Credible Claims Reserve: The Benktander Method - T. Mack (2000)

Benktander Method

### A3 Credible Claims Reserve

Credible Claims Reserve: Benktander, Neuhaus and Mack - W. Hurlimann

Method that is based on the incremental loss ratio triangles

Weight between the analogous development and BF method

$R_i^c = Z_iR_i^{ind} + (1-Z_i)R_i^{coll}$

| $Z_i$ | Method |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1     | Chainladder; Individual LR|
| 0     | BF; Collective LR|
| $p_i$ | Benktander |
| $p_i \times ELR$ | Neuhaus |
| $Z = \dfrac{p_i}{p_i + \sqrt{p_i}}$ | Optimal |
