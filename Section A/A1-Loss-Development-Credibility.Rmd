## Method Assumptions

| Method        | Formula      | Restrictions   |
| ------------- | ------------ | -------------- |
| Least Squares | $y = a + bx$ | No Restriction |
| Chainladder   | $y = bx$     | a = 0          |
| BF            | $y = a + x$  | b = 1          |
| ELR           | $y = a$      | b = 0          |

<a name="LS-formula"></a>**Least Squares Formula**

<span style="color:red; background:yellow">Memorize</span>

* $b = \dfrac{\overline{xy} - \bar{x}\bar{y}}{\overline{x^2}-\bar{x}^2} = \dfrac{\mathrm{Cov}(X,Y)}{\mathrm{Var}(X)}$

* $a = \bar{y} - b\bar{x}$

<span style="color:red">Use Calculator</span>

<a name="pros-cons"></a>**Caveat with Traditional Method**

* ***Chainladder***: Difficult to select LDF when vary from year to year
* ***BF***: Doesn't work well with negative development
* **ELR***: Ignores actual experience
* Difficulty with parameter estimation when loss patterns are changing
* Variable book $\Rightarrow$ sampling error $\Rightarrow$ *b* that doesn't reflect the true underlying characteristics

**Caveat with Least Squares**

* Good when dist^n^ is the same across multiple years
* Bad when systemic shift year to year e.g. inflation, legal environment (Tort reform)

## LS w/ Theoretical Dist^n^ Using Bayes

<a name="poi-bin"></a>**Poisson - Binomial**  
$Y =$ (Ultimate) # of claims incurred each year $\sim Poi(\mu)$  
$X =$ # of claims reported by year end $\sim Bin(y,d)$

Unreported claims = $R(x) = \mu(1-d)$ <span style="color:red; background:yellow">Memorize</span>

Simulation of Poi - Bin from paper shows that:

* LDF shows upward bias
* MSE of LDF is higher than MSE of LS

<a name="nb-bin"></a>**Negative Binomial - Binomial**  
$Y =$ (Ultimate) # of claims incurred each year $\sim NB(r, p)$

* $Y =$ # of failures until $r$ success with success probability = $p$

* $\mathrm{E[Y]} = \dfrac{r(1-p)}{p}$

$X =$ # of claims reported by year end $\sim Bin(y,d)$

Unreported claims = $R(x) = \dfrac{s}{1-s}(x + r)$ <span style="color:red; background:yellow">Memorize</span>

* $s = (1-d)(1-p)$

## Bayesian Credibility

<span style="color:red; background:yellow">Memorize</span>

**Best linear estimator** of Y|X

<a name="bayesian-cred"></a>$L(x) = (x - \mathrm{E[X]})\dfrac{Cov(X,Y)}{Var(X)} + \mathrm{E[Y]}$

* Y = Ultimate Losses; X = Reported Losses
* $L(x)$ = best linear estimator of Y|X = least square estimate
* Use this when we don't know the distribution of the random variable

| Scenarios | Implications |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| $x = \mathrm{E[X]}$ | $L(X) = \mathrm{E[Y]}$ |
| $\mathrm{Cov(X,Y)} \ll \mathrm{Var(X)}$ | $L(X) \approx \mathrm{E[Y]}$; Use ELR Method; X, Y don't vary tightly together|
| $\mathrm{Cov(X,Y)} \approx \mathrm{Var(X)}$ | $L(X) \approx x + \mathrm{E[Y - X]}$; Use BF Method |
| $\mathrm{Cov(X,Y)} \gg \mathrm{Var(X)}$ | Y is significantly influenced by X; Use Dev Method|

### Credibility Form of the Dev' Formula

<span style="color:red; background:yellow">Memorize</span>

<a name="dev-formula"></a>$L(x) = Z \underbrace{\dfrac{x}{d}}_{\begin{array}{c} \text{Dev'}\\ \text{Method}\\ \end{array}} + (1-Z)\underbrace{\mathrm{E[Y]}}_{ELR}$

* $L(x) = Q(x)$ when $Q(x)$ is linear

**Method 1 for Z**

* $Z = \dfrac{VHM}{VHM + EVPV} = \dfrac{\mathrm{Var_Y(E[X|Y])}}{\mathrm{Var_Y(E[X|Y])}+\mathrm{E_Y[Var(X|Y)]}}$

    * $VHM = d^2 \sigma^2_Y$
    
    * $EVPV = \sigma^2_d[\sigma^2_Y + \mathrm{E[Y]}^2]$
    
    * Use this when underlying distribution not stable (historical not a good predictor); LS only works when the underlying dist^n^ are stable

* $d =$ % reported

    * $d \: {\perp\!\!\!\perp} \: X$: reporting speed does not vary with the volume of claims
    
    * $D = \dfrac{X}{Y}$
    
* Results sensitive to $\mathrm{E[Y]}$ and $\mathrm{E[D]}$ but not the $\sigma$

* Based on estimates of VHM and EVPV of the dist^n^ instead

**Method 2 for Z**

* $Z = \dfrac{b}{c}$, where $c$ is the CDF and $b$ is from the LS

    * This yield the LS results <span style="color:red">(always?)</span>

    * Assume same $d$ for any size of $y$; Not necessarily true for large or small $y$

#### Special Case: Poi - Bin

* $L(x) = x + (1-d)\mathrm{E(Y)}$
* $Z = d$
* Same as BF
* **BF is optimal** when claim counts follow Poi - Bin

### Caseload Effect

When $D$ and $Y$ not independent still works

* e.g. $d$ larger for small $y$ since small claims are settle faster
* Or the opposite when large $y$ has as larger $d$: For a property book when large weather event happens, report quicker

<span style="color:red; background:yellow">Memorize</span>

<a name="case-load"></a>$L(x) = Z \dfrac{x - x_0}{d} + (1-Z)\mathrm{E[Y]}$

**Assumption**:  
$\mathrm{E[X|Y=y]} = dy + x_0$; $x_0$ is for the fixed salary

### Calculation Considerations

<a name="consid"></a>

**Normalize** the losses by dividing with premium since LS assume constant distribution and also ***adjust for inflation***

Calculates ATU, so needs the tail factor first and also start from the oldest period

Recursively go backwards using the previous estimates

$Z = \dfrac{b}{c}$; $c$ is the ATU

Notes:

* $a$ = Projected ultimate if no losses are reported

* AY matures $\Rightarrow a \: \downarrow$; $Z \uparrow$; $c \downarrow$

* If a < 0 $\Rightarrow$ Use Chainladder to make a = 0

* If b < 0 $\Rightarrow$ Use ELR

* If b = 0 $Rightarrow$ Same as BF

## Conclusions

<a name="conclusions"></a>

LS is the best linear estimate of $Q(x)$, the theoretical best estimate of the ultimate loss

LS produce more reasonable results when year to year fluctuations are severe

LS does not do well when the variations are due to underlying changes in the payment pattern (due to internal or external changes)

* e.g. When there is a systematic shift in the business

Subject to sampling error when estimating parameters similar to other methods
