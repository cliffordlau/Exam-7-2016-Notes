## Benktander Method (GB)

$R_{GB} = q_kU_{BF}$

* $q_k = (1 - p_k)$ = % unpaid loss @ $k$

* $U_{BF} = C_k + q_kU_0$

* Recognizes actual emergence faster $\Rightarrow$ Less weight on the a-priori

* Weight on $U_0$ is $q_k^2$

$U_{GB} = (1-q_k)U_{CL} + q_kU_{BF}$

MSE of Benkander is almost as small as the MSE of the optimal credibility in most cases

$MSE(R_{GB}) < MSE(R_{BF})$

* When $p_k \in [0, 2c^*]$; $c^*$ is the optimal credibility

* Doesn't hold if $c^*$ is small and $p_k$ is large

Theorem 3.1: As you iterate the Benktender many more times, the weight to $U_0$ approaches 0 and full credibility goes to the CL method
