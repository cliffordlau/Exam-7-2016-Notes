# ERA 3.1 Considerations on Implementing Internal Risk Model - Mango

Just know the 4 sections and have an idea of what it covers

1. [Startup: Staffing and Scope](#era-3-1-sec-1)

2. [IRM Parameter Development](#era-3-1-sec-2)

3. [Implementation](#era-3-1-sec-3)

4. [Integration and Mainteneance](#era-3-1-sec-4)

## Introduction {#era3-1-intro}

Creation of internal risk model

* Decisions at the beginning of the process

* How the input parameters should be determined

* How to overcome political hurdles

* How to integrate model into the company's business planning

## Startup: Staffing and Scope {#era-3-1-sec-1}

Important to define responsibilities of those involved and scope of the project

* Organization Chart

    * Reporting line of team

    * Leader needs reputation for fairness and balance

* Functions Represented

    * U/w, planning, actuarial, risk

* Resource Commitment

    * Full time or part time

* Critical Roles and Responsibilities

    * Control of inputs and outputs

    * Analyses and uses of output

* Purpose

    * Quantify variation around?

    * Objective view of dist^n^ of results?

* Scope

    * Prospective u/w year only?

    * Reserves, assets, op risk?

    * Low detail on whole company? or,

    * High detail on a pilot segment
    
## IRM Parameter Development {#era-3-1-sec-2}

Important **input** parameters to model:

* ELR

* LR dist^n^

* Expected premium

* Correlation amongst risk

* ESG

Other considerations:

* **Modeling software**: should match the capabilities of the team

* **Parameter development**: should include expertise from u/w, planning, claims and actuarial; have a systematic way to capture expert opinion

* **Correlations**: Have to be owned at a high level (C-suites) as it crosses LoBs and have significant impact on the allocated capital; Should have inputs from IRM team

* **Validation**: test and validate over extended period; provide training so that interested parties all have a basic understanding of the statistics

## Implementation {#era-3-1-sec-3}

Have senior management set priority and timeline for IRM analysis and rollout to prevent ambushes

* Give opinion leaders reasonable time frames to raise their concerns and have them addressed and not the power to veto or delay the rollout

* Don't attempt to sell the concept to various opinion leaders before moving forward

There will be a large appetite for the results of the IRM

Recommendations

* **Priority Setting**: Have top management set the priority for implementation

* **Communications**: Regular communication and to a broad audience

* **Pilot Testing**: Allows effective preparation of the company for the magnitude of the change

* **Education**: Training so leadership has a similar base level of understanding

## Integration and Mainteneance {#era-3-1-sec-4}

Make it part of the corporate calendar

* Cycle: Integrate into annual planning process

* Updating: Major updates no more than once per year

* Controls: Maintain centralized controls of inputs, outputs and even application templates
