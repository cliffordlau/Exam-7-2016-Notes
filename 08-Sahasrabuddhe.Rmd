## Introduction

**2 Key Parts**:

1) Convert a triangle to one level of trend and layer of losses

    * This is then used to determine LDFs at this base layer
    
2) Convert LDFs at a Base layer to LDFs at any other layer

**[Claim size models](#sahas-claim-size-model)** (distribution for individual claims)

* Exponential (in this paper)

* Different distribution for **each column** in the triangle

    Requires a distribution of losses at each age, which can be difficult 
    
    (Last section try to address this)

```{definition}
Sahasrabuddhe notations

$B$: Base layer, LDFs are determined at this layer

$X$: Layer of interest, ultimately we want LDFs for this layer

$\Phi_{ij}$: Cumulative loss dist^n^ in row $i$ age $j$

$LEV(X; \Phi_{ij})$: Limited Expected Value, average loss with dist^n^ $\Phi_{ij}$ capped at $X$

$F_{ij}^X$: LDF to ultimate for cell $ij$ with losses capped at $X$

$C^L_{ij}$: Cumulative paid to date for AY $i$, age $j$ in layer $L$
```

#### Claim Size Model {#sahas-claim-size-model}

Distribution of the individual losses (this unpins calculations we do [below](#base-tri))

***Properties of $\Phi_{ij}$***

1. Have parameters to adjust for inflation (e.g. Lognormal, Weibull, Exponential, Pareto)
    
    * Assumes that the only difference between the distribution of cells in the same column is trend ($T_{ij}$)
    
        $\therefore$ We have $\Phi_{ij} \sim f(\Phi_{nj},T_{ij},T_{nj})$
        
        * i.e. Distribution of $C_{ij}$ only depends on the things above
        
    * This allows us to choose one distribution for **each column**
    
        Specifically the distribution is selected for **row n** in each column and we use the trend factors to select the distribution for any cell in the same column
        
2. Mean (and limited means) can be calculated with reasonable effort

```{definition, sahas-ilf, name ="Increased Limits Factors"}
$$S_{ij}(L_a, L_b) = \dfrac{\text{Expected Losses for Layer }L_a}{\text{Expected Losses for Layer }L_b} = \dfrac{\mathrm{E}\left[ C^{L_a}_{ij} \right]}{\mathrm{E}\left[ C^{L_b}_{ij} \right]} = \dfrac{LEV(L_a; \Phi_{ij})}{LEV(L_b; \Phi_{ij})}$$

* Both for cell $C_{ij}$

* $L_a$: Layer $a$, deductible $d_a$ and policy limit $p_a$

* $L_b$: Layer $b$, deductible $d_b$ and policy limit $p_b$
```

## Part 1) Setup Base Layer Triangle {#base-tri}

Setup a consistent base layer triangle for LDFs selection

* We only need to go up [calculating LEV](#sahas-lev-calc) if we already have the base LDFs $F^B_{nj}$

### Setup the trend triangle

**Total Trend** = AY Trend $\times$ CY Trend

* No adjustment needed if only AY trend is present

    Since AY trend increases losses proportionally down each row

* CY trend should be on *incremental* losses

These are **ground up trend**, which is consistent if taken from external sources

Trend to the last row of the triangle

* Don't stop just at the diagonal

* We typically starts trending from the top left corner (but it doesn't have to)

    i.e. Have the 1.000 at the top left corner
    
* Get the AY and CY trend triangle separately and the multiply them together

***Caveat***:

* The paper applies the trend to cumulative loss which is problematic

* Cumulative trend depends on the incremental trend and the emergence pattern

**Output**: Trend triangle

### Calculate *unlimited* mean

We need the **unlimited** *mean* for **each cell** in triangle (Avg sev paid to date)

i) Based on **mean** for the **latest AY** (last row $n$)
    
$$C_{nj} \sim \Phi_{nj} = Exp(\theta_j)$$

$$\mathrm{E}[C_{nj}] = \theta_j$$

ii) **Detrend** the mean back up from the bottom row to fill the whole square

    * Practically, we usually just need to calculate this for 4 cells for the LDF conversion formula \@ref(eq:layer-b-to-x) (if we have the LDF already)

**Output**: Unlimited mean loss *table* adjusted for trend

### Calculate LEV {#sahas-lev-calc}

We need the **LEV** for **each cell** in:

* Triangle $L$, and

* Last row of $B$

```{block, type='rmdnote'}
Important formulas below
```

\begin{equation}
  LEV(X; \Phi \sim Exp(\theta)) = \theta \: \left[ 1 - \operatorname{exp}\left\{-\left(\dfrac{x}{\theta}\right)\right\} \right]
  (\#eq:sahas-lim-exp)
\end{equation}

```{remark}


* Use the table of means ($\theta$'s) calculated from Step 2

* Similarly, we only need 4 points for the calculates in part 2 if we don't need the LDFs

* This gives us everything for equation \@ref(eq:layer-b-to-x) if we already have the Base level LDF
```

**Output**: $LEV$ for each cell in triangle for layer $L$ and the last row for layer $B$

### Calculate the Base Layer Triangle and LDF

Convert triangle of actual losses by dividing it's LEV at layer $L$ then times it's LEV at layer $B$

\begin{equation}
  C_{ij}' = C_{ij}^L \times \underbrace{\dfrac{LEV(B;\Phi_{nj})}{LEV(L;\Phi_{ij})}}_{\text{ILF w/ on-level to }nj}
  (\#eq:base-layer-loss)
\end{equation}

```{remark}


* See definition \@ref(def:sahas-ilf) on the ILF component

* This takes losses from layer $L$ at trend level $ij$ to layer $B$ at trend level $nj$
```

Once we have the triangle we can select the base layer LDFs $F^B_{nj}$

## Part 2) Convert LDFs from Base Layer {#convert-ldf}

Convert LDFs from base layer to LDFs at any other layer

At this step we should already have $F_{nj}^B$ selected from the base triangle created above

\begin{equation}
  F_{ij}^X = F_{nj}^B \times \frac{LEV(X;\Phi_{i\infty})\div LEV(B;\Phi_{n\infty})}{LEV(X;\Phi_{ij}) \div LEV(B;\Phi_{nj})}
 (\#eq:layer-b-to-x)
\end{equation}

* Without trend, you can basically just take the middle part as the LDFs

    e.g. $F^B_{nj} = \dfrac{LEV(B; \Phi_{n \infty})}{LEV(B; \Phi_{nj})}$ then it all just cancels out

* However, we trust the LDF from the analysis of losses limited to $B$ more and less so with the distribution functions $\Phi$

    $\therefore$ We take the LDF from the limited analysis and scaling from layer $B$ to $X$

```{r sahas-base-to-ldf, echo = FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.show='hold', fig.cap='Converting LDFs from base layer to any other layer'}
knitr::include_graphics('figures/Exam-7-Notes-13.png')
```

### LDFs for Layers from Basic Limits to Policy Limits

\begin{equation}
  F_{ij} = F_{nj}^B \times \frac{ \left[{\color{blue}{LEV(Y;\Phi_{i\infty}) - }} LEV(X;\Phi_{i\infty})\right]\div LEV(B;\Phi_{n\infty})}{ \left[ {\color{blue}{LEV(Y;\Phi_{ij}) - }} LEV(X;\Phi_{ij}) \right] \div LEV(B;\Phi_{nj})}
  (\#eq:sahas-ldf-xs)
\end{equation}

$Y$ here is the policy limits and $X$ is the basic limits

## Other Practical Uses

If we don't have the severity distribution by age (as required by the denominator of equation \@ref(eq:layer-b-to-x)), we can work with the severity at ultimate and estimate $R_j(X,B)$, for lower layers $X < B$
 
\begin{equation}
  F_{ij}^X = F_{nj}^B \times \frac{LEV(X;\Phi_{i\infty})\div LEV(B;\Phi_{ {\color{red}i} \infty})}{R_j{(X,B)}}
  (\#eq:sahas-only-diag)
\end{equation}
 
* Note the $i$ in the second part of the numerator (I guess it's to be consistent with formula below)
 
* See how this change pictorially (Compare to fig. \@ref(fig:sahas-base-to-ldf))

Ratio of limited losses at layer $X$ to layer $B$ at age $j$

\begin{equation}
  R_{j}(X,B) = \dfrac{LEV(X;\Phi_{ij})}{LEV(B;\Phi_{ij})}
  (\#eq:sahas-ratio)
\end{equation}

* The ratio is calculated on the diagonal
    
* This needs to be estimated
    
Equation \@ref(eq:sahas-ratio) **assume**:

$$\dfrac{LEV(B; \Phi_{n \infty})}{LEV(B; \Phi_{nj})} \approx \dfrac{LEV(B; \Phi_{i \infty})}{LEV(B; \Phi_{ij})}$$
 
* Assumes the ratio of losses at different cost layers is immaterial

* The expected LDF in different AYs (row $n$ and $i$) are similar when losses are capped at $B$
    
* This is a reasonable assumption with **low inflation**

**Estimate $R_j(X,B)$ \@ref(eq:sahas-ratio)** 

$R_j(X,B)$ is bound by the following:

$$U_i \leq R_j(X,B) \leq U_i \cdot F_{ij}^{\infty} \leq 1$$

Where:

$$U_i = R_{i\infty}(X,B) = \dfrac{LEV(X;\Phi_{i\infty})}{LEV(B;\Phi_{i \infty})}$$

```{remark}


* For a given $j$, $R_{ij}(X,B)$ decreases as we move across the age $i$ since more losses pierce through the layer

* We expect $U_i$ to $\downarrow$ for more recent AYs due to loss trend; Larger % of losses  pierce the lower layer

    Larger losses are capped in the numerator but not as much in the denominator

* $U_i$ increases as we move to more mature years (??)

* $U_i$ is the ratio at ultimate of limited means; same as $R_{i \infty}$
```

Empirical example from text:

* Select a decay from 1.000 and approaches $U_i$ as maturity increase

* Overlay with empirical $R_j(X,B)$ along the diagonal

* Overlay with the $U_i$ ultimate ratios as well to serve as a floor

Estimate doesn't work when:

* There is expected negative development

* XS layer develops more quickly than a working layer

Upper bound:

* Get upper bound for $R_j$ by using unlimited losses for $B$ and the loss development factors from unlimited losses $B\infty$

## Issues with Assumptions

Three assumptions that are **likely reasonable**

1) Must select a basic limit $B$

2) Needs an ultimate claim size model

    * Or use ILFs
    
    * Just have to accurate around the basic limit and policy limit since that's where we calculate expectations
    
3) Need to create a triangle of losses at basic limit and one cost level

    * We do this in the step converting the base triangle

Two assumptions that are **more tenuous**

1) Requires robust claim size model at each age

    * Ultimately we need the *ratio* of limited losses at different layers, less import to get the absolute values correct
    
2) Trend

    * Trend should be applied to the incremental losses
    
    * Not clear how to apply trend to reported losses (by day of reserve or payment?)
