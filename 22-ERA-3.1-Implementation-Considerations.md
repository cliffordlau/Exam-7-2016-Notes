# C3 ERA 3.1 Considerations on Implementing Internal Risk Model - Mango

## Cliff's Summary

Just know the 4 sections and have an idea of what it covers

## Introduction

Creation of internal risk model

* Decisions at the beginning of the process
* How the input parameters should be determined
* How to overcome political hurdles
* How to integrate model into the company's business planning

## Startup: Staffing and Scope

Important to define responsibilities of those involved and scope of the project

* Organization Chart
    * Reporting line of team
    * Leader needs reputation for fairness and balance
* Functions Represented
    * U/w, planning, actuarial, risk
* Resource Commitment
    * Full time or part time
* Critical Roles and Responsibilities
    * Control of inputs and outputs
    * Analyses and uses of output
* Purpose
    * Quantify variation around?
    * Objective view of dist^n^ of results?
* Scope
    * Prospective u/w year only?
    * Reserves, assets, op risk?
    * Low detail on whole company? or,
    * High detail on a pilot segment
    
## IRM Parameter Development

Important **input** parameters to model:

* ELR
* LR dist^n^
* Expected premium
* Correlation amongst risk
* ESG

Other considerations:

* **Modeling software**: should match the capabilities of the team
* **Parameter development**: should include expertise from u/w, planning, claims and actuarial; have a systematic way to capture expert opinion
* **Correlations**: Have to be owned at a high level (C-suites) as it crosses LoBs and have significant impact on the allocated capital; Should have inputs from IRM team
* **Validation**: test and validate over extended period; provide training so that interested parties all have a basic understanding of the statistics

## Implementation

Have senior management set priority and timeline for IRM analysis and rollout to prevent ambushes

* Give opinion leaders reasonable time frames to raise their concerns and have them addressed and not the power to veto or delay the rollout

* Don't attempt to sell the concept to various opinion leaders before moving forward

There will be a large appetite for the results of the IRM

Recommendations

* **Priority Setting**: Have top management set the priority for implementation
* **Communications**: Regular communication and to a broad audience
* **Pilot Testing**: Allows effective preparation of the company for the magnitude of the change
* **Education**: Training so leadership has a similar base level of understanding

## Integration and Mainteneance

Make it part of the corporate calendar

* Cycle: Integrate into annual planning process
* Updating: Major updates no more than once per year
* Controls: Maintain centralized controls of inputs, outputs and even application templates
